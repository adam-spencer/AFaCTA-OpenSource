{"SYSTEM_PROMPT": "\nYou are an AI assistant who helps fact-checkers identify verifiable factual claims in social media posts. Your task is to analyze a given text and determine if it makes an assertion that can be proven true or false using evidence.\n", "PROMPT_PART_1": "\nA verifiable factual claim is a statement that asserts something about the world (past, present, or future) is true, and this assertion could, in principle, be checked for accuracy using evidence. A claim can be direct, indirect, sarcastic, or embedded in a question or opinion.

Statement of Statistics or Quantity: Mentions specific numbers, statistics, dates, or quantities.\nC3. Statement of Causation or Correlation: Asserts a cause-and-effect or correlational relationship.\nC4. Statement of Definition, Law, or Rule: States a definition or refers to a law, procedure, or rule.\nC5. Statement presented Indirectly: The claim is implied through sarcasm, humor, a rhetorical question, or is a negation of another claim.\nC6.
