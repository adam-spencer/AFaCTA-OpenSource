SYSTEM_PROMPT = '''
You are an AI assistant who helps fact-checkers identify verifiable factual claims in social media posts. Your task is to analyze a given text and determine if it makes an assertion that can be proven true or false using evidence.
'''

PROMPT_PART_1 = '''
A verifiable factual claim is a statement that asserts something about the world (past, present, or future) is true, and this assertion could, in principle, be checked for accuracy using evidence. A claim can be direct, indirect, sarcastic, or embedded in a question or opinion. It is not a pure opinion, a command, a hope, or a question that does not assert anything.

Based on this definition, does the following <sentence> from a Tweet contain a verifiable factual claim?

<sentence>: "{sentence}"

Answer with Yes or No only.
'''

PROMPT_PART_2 = '''
A verifiable factual claim is a statement asserting something as true that could be checked with evidence. It is not a simple opinion, hope, command, or a question without an embedded assertion.

Categories of factual claims:
C1. Statement of Event or Personal Experience: Reports a specific event (past, present, or future) or a personal experience.
C2. Statement of Statistics or Quantity: Mentions specific numbers, statistics, dates, or quantities.
C3. Statement of Causation or Correlation: Asserts a cause-and-effect or correlational relationship.
C4. Statement of Definition, Law, or Rule: States a definition or refers to a law, procedure, or rule.
C5. Statement presented Indirectly: The claim is implied through sarcasm, humor, a rhetorical question, or is a negation of another claim.
C6. Statement about Media Content: Describes the content of an image, video, or linked resource.

Please first analyze the objective and subjective components of the following <statement> from a Tweet.
Then, extract the core factual claim being made.
Then, carefully reason if the extracted claim is specific enough to be verifiable (i.e., could a fact-checker investigate it?).
Finally, answer if the claim falls into the above categories (C1 to C6) or is not a verifiable factual claim (C0).

<statement>: "{sentence}"

Format your answer in JSON with the following keys in order:
{{
"ANALYSIS": "What are the objective (verifiable) and subjective (non-verifiable) components of the <statement>?",
"FACT_PART": "The single, core factual claim extracted from the statement. If no claim exists, state 'N/A'.",
"VERIFIABLE_REASON": "A detailed reason explaining why the extracted fact is or is not verifiable. A claim is not verifiable if it is too vague, is a pure opinion/hope/command, or lacks specific details. A claim can be verifiable even if it's sarcastic, a prediction, or part of an opinion.",
"VERIFIABILITY": "A boolean value indicating the verifiability of the extracted claim.",
"CATEGORY": "C1 to C6, or C0 if not a claim."
}}

PROMPT_OBJECTIVE = '''
Concisely argue that the following <sentence> from a Tweet contains a verifiable factual claim.
A verifiable factual claim asserts something as true that can be checked with evidence. Remember to consider claims that are:
- Reporting on events, statistics, or personal experiences.
- Stating cause-and-effect relationships.
- Making verifiable predictions.
- Presented indirectly through sarcasm, humor, or rhetorical questions.
- Embedded within an opinion (e.g., "I think X happened").
- Negations of other claims (e.g., "X is not a cure").

Focus on any part of the sentence that makes a specific, testable assertion about the world.

<sentence>: "{sentence}"
'''

PROMPT_SUBJECTIVE = '''
Concisely argue that the following <sentence> from a Tweet does NOT contain a verifiable factual claim.
A verifiable factual claim must assert something as true that can be checked with evidence. Argue that the sentence is instead one of the following:
- A pure opinion, preference, or feeling with no verifiable component (e.g., "I think X is better than Y," "I hope...").
- A command, piece of advice, or a warning.
- A pure question that does not embed or imply a factual assertion.
- Too vague or lacks specific details to be verifiable.
- A meta-statement about claims (e.g., "Stop saying X is true").

Focus on why the sentence does not make a specific, testable assertion about the world.

<sentence>: "{sentence}"

JUDGE_PROMPT = '''
Two AI assistants are debating whether the following <sentence> from a Tweet contains a verifiable factual claim.

A verifiable factual claim asserts something as true that could, in principle, be checked for accuracy using evidence. It is not a pure opinion, a command, or a question that does not assert anything.

<sentence>: "{sentence}"

Assistant A's View (arguing it CONTAINS a claim): "{assistant_a}"

Assistant B's View (arguing it DOES NOT contain a claim): "{assistant_b}"

Based on the definition provided and the two arguments, does the <sentence> contain a verifiable factual claim? Which perspective do you align with more closely?
Please reply with "Lean towards A", or "Lean towards B" only.
