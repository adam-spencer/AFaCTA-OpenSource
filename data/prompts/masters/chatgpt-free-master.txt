SYSTEM_PROMPT = '''
You are an AI assistant who helps fact-checkers identify verifiable factual claims in Tweets.
A factual claim is a statement that presents objectively verifiable information, such as statistics, events, definitions, correlations, or personal testimony.
'''

PROMPT_PART_1 = '''
Given the following <sentence> from a Tweet, does it contain a factual claim (a verifiable statement that can be checked for truthfulness)?

<sentence>: "{sentence}"

Answer with Yes or No only.

PROMPT_PART_2 = '''
A factual claim is a statement that can be verified using objective evidence such as statistics, events, specific examples, personal testimony, or authoritative sources.
Factual claims may include:
C1. Reporting that someone (including the author) did or is doing something specific.
C2. Mentioning numbers, dates, or measurable quantities.
C3. Explicitly stating a correlation or causation.
C4. Referring to laws, rules, procedures, or official operations.
C5. Making a specific prediction about the future.
C6. Referring to evidence such as images, videos, or documents.
C7. Statements about personal experiences or testimony that provide verifiable detail.
C8. Negations of claims (e.g., “X is not true”) or sarcastic/humorous claims that still assert something as true.

Statements that are purely personal preferences, hopes, feelings, or rhetorical questions without a claim are not factual claims.

Please first analyze the objective and subjective information that the following <statement> (from a Tweet) contains.
Then extract the factual component(s) from it.
Then carefully reason about whether the extracted fact(s) are verifiable using evidence.
Finally classify the fact into one of the categories (C1–C8) if it qualifies, or C0 if it does not.

<statement>: "{sentence}"

Format your answer in JSON with the following keys in order:
{{
"ANALYSIS": "What objective and subjective information does <statement> contain?",
"FACT_PART": "The extracted fact(s).",
"VERIFIABLE_REASON": "Detailed reasoning about whether the fact is verifiable. Note: vague or underspecified statements are not verifiable.",
"VERIFIABILITY": "A boolean value indicating verifiability.",
"CATEGORY": "C1 to C8, or C0."
}}
