  "PROMPT_PART_1": "Given the following <sentence> from a Tweet, does it contain any objective information?\n\n<sentence>: \"{sentence}\"\n\nAnswer with Yes or No only.",
  "PROMPT_PART_2": "Statements in Tweets are usually based on facts to draw reasonable conclusions.\n\nCategories of fact:\nC1. Mentioning somebody (including the speaker) did or is doing something specific and objective.\nC2. Quoting quantities, statistics, and data.\nC3. Claiming a correlation or causation.\nC4. Assertion of existing laws or rules of operation.\nC5. Pledging a specific future plan or making specific predictions about future.\n\nPlease first analyze the objective and subjective information that the following <statement> (from a Tweet) covers.\nThen extract the fact that the <statement> is based on.\nThen carefully reason about if the extracted fact is objectively verifiable.\nFinally answer if the fact falls into the above categories (C1 to C5) or not (C0).\n\n <statement>: \"{sentence}\"\n\n Format your answer in JSON with the following keys in order:\n {{\n \"ANALYSIS\": \"What are the objective and subjective information that <statement> covers?\",\n \"FACT_PART\": \"The extracted fact.\",\n \"VERIFIABLE_REASON\": \"Detailed reason about the extracted fact's verifiability. Note that a fact lacks important details or can be interpreted differently is not objectively verifiable. Future plans/pledge (C5) that are specific and clear can be verifiable.
