{"SYSTEM_PROMPT": "You are an AI assistant who helps fact-checkers to identify statements which contain factual claims.\n\nA factual claim is a statement that explicitly presents some verifiable facts (i.e. provide enough specific information to guide fact checkers in verification). \nStatements with subjective components like opinions can also be factual claims if they explicitly present objectively verifiable facts.", "PROMPT_PART_1": "Given the following <sentence> from a Tweet, does it contain any factual claims?\n\n<sentence>: \"{sentence}\"\n\nAnswer with Yes or No only.", "PROMPT_PART_2": "Statements in Tweets are usually based on facts to draw reasonable conclusions.\n\nCategories of fact:\nC1. Mentioning somebody (including the speaker) did or is doing something specific and objective.\nC2. Quoting quantities, statistics, and data.\nC3. Claiming a correlation or causation.\nC4. Assertion of existing laws or rules of operation.\nC5. Pledging a specific future plan or making specific predictions about future.\n\nPlease first analyze the objective and subjective information that the following <statement> (from a Tweet) covers.\nThen extract the fact that the <statement> is based on.\nThen carefully reason about if the extracted fact is objectively verifiable.\nFinally answer if the fact falls into the above categories (C1 to C5) or not (C0).\n\n<statement>: \"{sentence}\"\n\nFormat your answer in JSON with the following keys in order:\n{{\n\"ANALYSIS\": \"What are the objective and subjective information that <statement> covers?\",\n\"FACT_PART\": \"The extracted fact.\",\n\"VERIFIABLE_REASON\": \"Detailed reason about the extracted fact's verifiability. Note that a fact lacks important details or can be interpreted differently is not objectively verifiable. Future plans/pledge (C5) that are specific and clear can be verifiable. Citing others' words is verifiable and falls into C1. \",\n\"VERIFIABILITY\": \"A boolean value indicates the verifiability.\",\n\"CATEGORY\": \"C1 to C5, or C0.\"\n}}", "PROMPT_OBJECTIVE": "Concisely argue that the following <sentence> from a Tweet does contain factual claim(s).\n\n<sentence>: \"{sentence}\"", "PROMPT_SUBJECTIVE": "Concisely argue that the following <sentence> from a Tweet does not contain any factual claims.\n\n<sentence>: \"{sentence}\"", "JUDGE_PROMPT": "Two AI assistants are debating about whether the following <sentence> (from a Tweet) contains any factual claims.\n\n<sentence>: \"{sentence}\"\n\nAssistant A's View: \"{assistant_a}\"\n\nAssistant B's View: \"{assistant_b}\"\n\nBased on the above, does <sentence> contain any factual claims?
