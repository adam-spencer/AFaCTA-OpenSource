SENTENCES
"Lieutenant Governor Ainsworth, President Pro Tempore Reed, Speaker McCutcheon, Speaker Pro Tempore Gaston, members of the Alabama Legislature, Chief Justice Parker, justices of the Alabama Supreme Court, distinguished guests and my fellow Alabamians!"
I am a firm believer – that for Alabama – there is no mountain too steep to climb and no dream that is unattainable.
"Over the last four years, we have proved that to be the gospel truth by coming together to solve some of the state’s toughest challenges."
"To you, the people of Alabama and the men and women of the Legislature: You are the reason for our progress."
"This evening, I renew my commitment to you that we will not only continue tackling old problems."
"We will work together as Alabamians to find new solutions so that our state is the best place to live, work and raise a family for years to come."
"I am pleased to report that the state of our state is strong and that if you join me in my bold vision for the future of Alabama, I am confident that our best days are in front of us!"
President Ronald Reagan once said that there are no barriers to our progress except those we erect ourselves.
I have found that to be true here in Alabama.
"It was up to us to decide that it’s always time to do what’s right, even if it’s not the politically popular thing to do."
"When our prison system went unaddressed for decades and resulted in serious challenges, we found a way toward a solution."
"When our roads and bridges were in need for desperate improvements, we found a way to make significant progress all across the state."
"When our federal government overreached, we found a way to fight back."
"When all of us in this room come together with the people of our state, Alabama will always find a way."
"I promised to address the issues facing our corrections system once and for all, and I have said that to make progress, we must first replace our costly and crumbling facilities."
I commend the men and women of the Legislature for joining me on that mission as we moved the Alabama Prison Program across the finish line this past fall.
I am certain this critical step will make a significant difference for decades to come.
I promised that our roads would be the envy of the nation.
"While our work is far from over, we have made significant progress thanks to the Rebuild Alabama Act."
"As promised, every single penny has gone to road and bridge projects, as well as to our Port."
"I am proud to report that on top of the local improvements, the state has administered projects in almost all 67 counties already, and like I said, we’ve only just begun."
"We are delivering on decades talked-about projects like The West Alabama Corridor, which will connect Mobile all the way to Tuscaloosa with a four-lane highway."
We are tackling other needed projects to increase capacity like six-laning I-10 in West Mobile from Theodore to Irvington.
"And tonight, I am proud to announce that we will be widening I-59 from Chalkville Mountain Road to I-459, in east Jefferson County near Trussville, from four lanes to six lanes."
"Thanks to Rebuild Alabama, we are also making improvements to Alabama’s Deepwater Port in Mobile."
"With the current global supply issues, having an international resource in the Port of Mobile is ever more critical."
"As a matter of fact, our exports are up almost 25%."
"And here in Alabama, we aren’t having issues like they are in California."
"To the rest of the nation, I say loud and clear that Alabama’s Port of Mobile is open for business!"
We are proud to invite the nation and the world to do business with Alabama at our Port.
"Let me also add that in Alabama, we actually know what we are talking about when we use the word “infrastructure."
"When you compare what we have accomplished by working together with what our national leaders in Washington have been doing, the difference is quite clear."
"Speaking of D. C. politics – and I use the word “politics” intentionally here – from the moment the White House rolled out their scare tactic plans to try to force the covid-19 vaccine on Americans, I assured the people of Alabama that we were standing firmly against it."
"I’ll call this nonsense what it is, and that is an un-American, outrageous breach of our federal law."
"While the Legislature has stood with me in opposing these federal mandates, we have also been fortunate to have a strong leader in Attorney General Steve Marshall, who hasn’t shied away from the fight one bit."
"Attorney General Marshall, thank you for standing tall for Alabamians."
"As I have said all along, the courts are where we will win this battle."
"While Washington, D. C. seems to be filled with partisan politics, Alabama is blessed to have strong representation by our congressional delegation led by our senior Senator Richard Shelby."
"Last year, Senator Shelby announced he would not seek reelection."
"Beginning with his service in the Alabama State Senate in 1970 and continuing over four terms in the U. S. House and now six terms in the U. S. Senate, Richard Shelby has been instrumental in giving Alabama a seat at the table and has been vital in our state’s successes."
"We are proud of all he has accomplished for us and congratulate him and his wife Annette on their truly impactful contributions to our state and nation, and we thank our entire federal delegation for their service."
"When President Trump signed the CARES Act into law, we in Alabama quickly acted to ensure that those funds went directly into the hands of Alabamians."
"From our small businesses to our churches, non-profits and classrooms, I am proud that working with the men and women in this room, Alabama used every cent and invested it wisely."
"But even today as states like Alabama are making record economic comebacks, Congress is wanting our country to spend more and more federal dollars, and now we are tasked with allocating the American Rescue Plan Act funds."
We must be smart with this one-time money and commit to the people of Alabama that we will wisely invest – not just casually spend – these dollars.
I’ll say again that these federal dollars are just one-time funds.
"I challenge you, members of the Legislature, to make allocating these funds an early priority and to put these monies to meet some of Alabama’s biggest challenges like statewide broadband connectivity, water and sewer infrastructure, as well as investing funds in our hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers."
"Folks, no doubt, the last couple of years have been especially trying for our medical professionals."
"So, to our doctors, nurses and other health care staff, I offer my sincere thanks and appreciation."
"In my budget proposals, we will fully fund our rainy-day accounts."
We will make robust investments that will pay long-term dividends to the state.
"Thanks to the wise approach by the Legislature over the years in saving dollars and putting these funds to good use, during my time as governor, we have not once used the word “proration” or spent beyond our means."
"As we prepare our budgets for any possible events in our nation’s economy, today, Alabama’s economy is rock solid."
"Our preliminary numbers for 2021, even despite all of the curveballs we have been thrown, are looking strong."
"It is projected that Alabama saw investments totaling $5.4 billion with some 9,000 new jobs created."
"I predict to you tonight – in fact, I am confident – that our final numbers will be even bigger."
"So often, we hear people – who have likely not even stepped foot in Alabama – give their two cents on us."
"Here in Sweet Home Alabama, we are landing massive investments like Smucker’s $1.1 billion move to McCalla."
"While there are global strains, our automakers – supported by Alabama’s hardworking, non-union workforce – are hitting major milestones."
"Our aerospace and aviation sector remains strong, and we are building rockets and developing technologies to get this country back to the top when it comes to space exploration."
"In the current push for electric vehicles, so often, what is left out of the conversation is the fact that we are having to rely on other countries for an important ingredient in producing the EV batteries."
"Now, our country will turn to Westwater Resources in Coosa County for this critical resource in battery manufacturing."
"My fellow Alabamians, Made in Alabama is committed to bringing back Made in America."
"Clearly, with one of the nation’s lowest unemployment rates, Alabama is on the fast track."
"On top of our second to none workforce, Alabama also has an abundance of natural beauty – from the rolling green mountains to the sparkling waters of our Gulf Coast."
It’s no wonder that we saw north of 1.2 million more visitors to our Alabama State Parks or that our state’s tourism industry just had one of the best years on record.
"I declare to you tonight that by making every effort to expand outdoor recreation and by ensuring continued developments in our hospitality industry, the future of both of these sectors is bright."
I know that every one of us in this room is extremely grateful to call Alabama our home.
We live by our values and faith.
We lend a helping hand to each other.
"We support our military and honor our veterans who have served, and we back our men and women in blue."
"This past year, we lost 13 of Alabama’s own."
We are reminded far too often of the grave sacrifice our officers face every day.
We must ask ourselves what more can be done to protect these brave men and women.
"Here in Alabama, we are funding our law enforcement officers and looking to make positive changes that benefit both officers and our communities."
"Last year, I was proud to announce a partnership between the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency and KultureCity."
"Thanks to this first-of-its kind partnership, every ALEA trooper is now trained to be sensory- inclusive."
"Folks, Alabama is the first state in the nation to take this major step forward."
"I am proud of the work that our state troopers do, as well as the work of folks like our corrections officers, mental health care workers and others, which is why I am pleased to propose a well-deserved 4% pay raise for our state employees."
All of us stand on the shoulders of others who preceded us.
"In fact, the hard work of state employees has allowed us to accomplish many of the things we celebrate today."
"So, as part of my budget proposal, I will include a bonus for all retired state employees."
"I am proud that my Administration, with the support of the Legislature, is doing more to make significant improvements in mental health care than any since Governor Lurleen Wallace in the 1960s."
"In my commitment to expanding access to quality mental health care, I am proposing a $12 million investment for two additional mental health crisis centers, as well as other health services."
"Tonight, I am speaking to you as your governor, but I also am speaking to you as someone whose career journey began as a high school civics teacher."
"And as a former educator, I say that the single most important issue here in Alabama and in our nation is our children’s education."
"No doubt, the covid-19 pandemic shined a light on our country’s education system in many ways."
Let me be crystal clear: it is more critical than ever that every Alabama student is receiving in-person learning.
"Despite the fact Alabama led others states in getting kids back in the classroom, last year during this occasion, I called on our local school districts to work with community partners to close the learning gap."
"That is why tonight, I am proud to propose funding for after school programs I know will go a long way in getting our students on track for success."
"In Alabama, our students will be focused on core curriculum."
That means being proficient readers by the end of third grade.
"After we collect useful data during this upcoming spring semester, implementing the Alabama Literacy Act will be a must."
"We must also ensure our kids are focused on developing their math skills, studying history – not theory – and mastering other classes like science and writing."
"Tonight, I am pleased to lend my support to legislation that will create a Math Task Force to provide timely and actionable recommendations for recruiting and retaining math teachers, increasing support for struggling students, as well as for evaluating the quality of our assessments, learning materials and standards."
"South Carolina U. S. Senator Tim Scott said last year, “education is the closest thing to magic in America."
I say that we cannot continue letting our students and teachers struggle and rob them of a chance to achieve their dreams.
"This evening, I present a challenge to our schools, our communities, our citizens and our leaders."
"We should pledge, together, that we will no longer accept the existence of a failing elementary school in our state."
Early learning is the bedrock of a quality education.
How can we expect to have successful middle and high schools if we have failing elementary schools?
"To that end, I am proposing resources to support grants for failing elementary schools that are not one-size-fits- all, but rather, are customized to the particular needs of each of those struggling schools."
Money isn’t going to fix our problems in education.
"We need to work with these schools with an Alabama spirit of cooperation and determination, and we need to find new ways to address old problems."
That begins with making sure that every elementary school in Alabama is a successful school.
We will ensure we recruit and retain good teachers.
We are expanding funding to math and science teachers.
"We need more highly qualified math and science teachers if we want to improve student achievement and prepare our children for the new economy, and we must continue to work every single day toward this goal."
"My fellow Alabamians, teachers along the way have made a difference in each of our lives."
"The job of teachers is no small task, and during the height of covid, parents witnessed firsthand the adjustments and the obstacles that faced our educators."
"To that end, tonight, I am proud to once again propose a well-deserved 4% pay increase for our teachers."
We are increasing our investment in our students from our earliest learners in pre-k to those in our higher educational institutions.
We are providing needed resources for things like autism therapy and school-based mental health care.
"Folks, if we do not give our best to make meaningful changes to our education system, we will hurt the future of this state."
"And most importantly, we will hurt our most promising and precious resources – our students."
"My fellow Alabamians, I believe in the potential of our state like never before, because I believe in each one of you."
"We are a state of innovators, thinkers and dreamers."
Our state’s history is proof of that.
"In 1903, before Henry Ford had even invented the Model A, it was a young lady from Greene County, Mary Anderson who came up with the idea of windshield wipers."
"Around that time, George Washington Carver accepted a teaching appointment with Booker T. Washington and, together, they put Tuskegee Institute on the map."
"A few miles to the west of Tuskegee, the Wright brothers established America’s first civilian flying school in an old cotton field on the outskirts of Montgomery."
And that old cotton field became known as Maxwell Air Force Base a couple decades later.
"Fast forward to the 1960s, and it was a German scientist, Dr. Wernher von Braun, who would lead his team of scientists as the director of the new Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville."
He would then go on to become the chief architect of the Saturn V that would take mankind to the moon.
"And in 2021, the United States Air Force selected Huntsville – the best choice – as the permanent headquarters for the U. S. Space Command."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if innovation and discovery are in our DNA – and they are – just imagine what lies ahead for us if we work together to lay the groundwork for tomorrow."
"If we do that, and if we continue to make strategic improvements and investments where they count, then I assure you that decades from now, people from all across the country – and around the world – will be talking about the Alabama transformation we helped lead."
"That, my friends, is what’s in front of us."
There is great possibility in the future of Alabama.
May God continue to bless each of you and the great state of Alabama.
"Thank you Lieutenant Governor Meyer, Senate President Micciche, Speaker Stutes, and members of the 32nd Legislature."
"I’m glad to be back at the capitol addressing the Legislature in person, and I thank you for the invitation to speak to you tonight."
"I first want to recognize my wife of 34 years, First Lady Rose Dunleavy."
Alaska made history this past year.
A stellar young Alaskan who could not be here tonight also deserves some recognition.
Lydia Jacoby of Seward stunned the world last summer in Tokyo when she won gold with a thrilling finish to the 100-meter breaststroke in record time.
We saw Lydia’s friends and neighbors cheering her on in that famous video that quickly went around the world from the Seward ferry terminal.
Alaskans around the state were cheering right along with them.
"On behalf of Lydia’s fellow Alaskans, I know we’re going to keep cheering her on in everything she does going forward."
We can’t wait to see what else she’ll accomplish.
Let’s all give Lydia a great round of applause.
"Another special guest that made history this past year is our own Miss Alaska now known as Miss America, Emma Broyles."
"Emma, a graduate of Service High in Anchorage, broke through as the first Miss Alaska, and first of Korean heritage, to win the title of Miss America in the 100- year history of the competition."
"Because of her personal experiences, she is using her platform to bring awareness to ADHD and OCD, and highlighting community building through the Special Olympics."
"This past semester at Arizona State, where she is enrolled in the Honors College studying biomedicine with plans to enter medical school, Emma passed 21 credit hours, worked two jobs, and took three finals on the day she left for the Miss America competition."
Her hard work and tenacity embodies the 21st Century Miss America.
But her victory almost didn’t happen.
"During the interview competition, Emma shared her experience of hitting “rock bottom” while isolated in her dorm early in the pandemic."
"At times, her schoolwork and distance from her home state made her wonder if she should give up her Miss Alaska title."
"At the competition, Emma was asked why she was sharing her most vulnerable self with the rest of the world."
"“A lot of people,” she said, “don’t recognize that their low points are what are going to propel them to their future."
"Emma, we are so glad you stuck with it, and we are so proud of you."
"You have only just begun a lifetime of making a positive difference in the lives of others with the story you share, and the example you set."
"You represent Alaska’s strength, our diversity, and how we stand up when we get knocked down."
"Thank you, Emma, for being here tonight, and for being an inspiration to all of us."
Could you please stand and be recognized?
Young people like Emma and Lydia are showing the world what Alaskans are made of.
We take great pride in being Alaskans.
We take great pride in facing challenges head on.
"We don’t retreat, and we don’t accept defeat."
We also take great pride in helping our neighbors when things get tough.
"From the Interior to Western Alaska, from the Mat-Su Valley to Southeast, including right here in Juneau, we have seen winter weather that has wrought tremendous destruction on our Great State."
The storms have required state disaster declarations covering almost half of our boroughs and the communities they include.
"We are so thankful that we haven’t suffered any loss of life, and it’s always heartening to see and hear stories of Alaskans pitching in to help each other."
"Neighbors, utility workers, contractors, our Department of Transportation, our National Guard, and countless others, have all answered the call to help, sometimes under the most hazardous conditions.We couldn’t be more grateful."
Our National Guard is ready to respond at a moment’s notice when called upon thanks to members like Captain Andrew Viray.
"Captain Viray is a lifelong Alaskan, a graduate of East High in 2010, and the University of Alaska Anchorage and ROTC in 2014."
"He was commissioned into the Army National Guard as an infantry officer after graduating, and is serving as a plans and projects officer with the First-297th until he takes command of an Infantry Rifle Company in the coming months."
Captain Viray has been a leader in our COVID response through the Joint Task Force we stood up in March 2020.
"After returning from deployment to Kosovo in June 2020, he volunteered for the Joint Task Force assignment."
"He has assisted in warehouse operations, our airport testing program, and elections support in the Y-K Delta."
"More recently, he’s served as a staff planner in our Joint Task Force emergency responses in Fairbanks, the Mat-Su, and Yakutat."
"When he’s not answering the call for our National Guard, he is enrolled at the University of Alaska Anchorage pursuing his master of social work degree and is on track to graduate in May 2023."
"Captain Viray is here tonight, and I’d like to ask him to stand and be recognized for his dedication to Alaska, his exemplary service, and on behalf of all our National Guard members."
"Thank you for being here tonight, Captain, and for standing up for all Alaskans."
"After everything we’ve faced over the past three years, it’s my honor to report that not only is the State of our State Resilient, we’re fulfilling our motto of “North to the Future."
"Despite earthquakes; despite floods; despite fires, wind, ice, and snow; Despite hostile policies coming from Washington, DC; despite a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic; Despite these obstacles and against all odds, we’re not only still here, we are moving forward, and, yes, we are Open for Business."
Here’s what I’m talking about: The state of our fiscal situation has vastly improved from the budget deficit of $1.6 billion I inherited upon taking office.
"Thanks in part to our fiscal restraint over the past three years, we’re on track for a budget surplus in the current fiscal year for the first time in a decade."
"Based on current trends, we could see revenue in the current year increase by more than $281 million over the fall forecast and by $466 million in the upcoming fiscal year."
"This can generate a surplus this year, and next, even without one-time federal funds."
"Regarding crime, thanks to the repeal of Senate Bill 91, Alaskans are safer today than we have been in decades!"
"When I first stood before this chamber three years ago, I declared war on criminals and asked for the Legislature to repeal and replace the catch-and- release policies in SB 91."
"With the help of many of you, we got it done.Policies do matter."
We’ve seen our overall crime rate decline by 10 percent in 2019 and another 18.5 percent in 2020!
"According to the FBI, reported property crimes are at the lowest level since 1974."
The murder rate has declined by a whopping 31 percent from 2019 to 2020.
We all remember the huge spike in car thefts after SB 91 was signed in 2016.
"Following the repeal of SB 91, vehicle thefts were down 54 percent in 2020 compared to 2017."
Burglary and larceny theft dropped by 22 percent from 2019 to 2020; robberies dropped by almost 15 percent in the same time.
These figures from the FBI are indisputable.
"Never again can we put criminals ahead of victims, or social engineering ahead of public safety."
"When we express appreciation for law enforcement, we usually just think about our State Troopers or local Police forces."
"Too often, we forget about our men and women serving in the Department of Corrections."
"It’s a difficult, typically thankless job, but no less critical to public safety."
One of our most senior Corrections officers is Staff Sergeant of Operations Ken Noland.
"Sergeant Noland, an Alaskan since age 8 and a graduate of Bartlett High School in Anchorage, started his career with the department in 1994 at Spring Creek in Seward."
"He’s been at the Anchorage Correctional Complex since April 1998, and he was promoted to Sergeant in June of 2005."
Sergeant Noland is a diligent and generous officer who has mentored and trained his peers in those values for more than 25 years.
"According to those peers, his positive attitude and exceptional work ethic help create an environment that recognizes the difficulties faced by Corrections staff while treating everyone with the dignity they deserve."
"Sergeant Noland is a fine example for our Corrections Department, and I’m happy he is here tonight to be recognized not only for his service, but for the service of all his fellow officers he represents."
"Sergeant Noland, could you please stand and be recognized?Thank you, Sergeant."
I’m also glad to report good news from the North Slope.
"To date this fiscal year, our oil production and prices are better than forecasted."
"As Alaskans, we know the price of oil is volatile."
In just the past two years we’ve seen prices go from negative to nearly $90 per barrel.
"We know better than to take current prices for granted, and we must continue to hold the line on state spending without sacrificing core services, and that includes the PFD."
"Our Permanent Fund is now worth $82 billion, and our multi-billion-dollar pension gap is virtually closed."
The performance of the Permanent Fund solidifies our state government’s fiscal situation by smoothing out the highs and lows in oil prices.
"The outstanding returns of our pension funds are freeing up revenue that can be devoted to core government responsibilities like Public Safety and Infrastructure, without imposing taxes."
This just didn’t happen on its own.It’s not just an accident.
"It’s the result of great investment decisions, policies, vision, and direction."
Our great state is pointed in the right direction; our focus is where it should be on Alaska’s future.
"In the near future, our $4.5 billion tourism industry is poised to welcome millions of travelers back to Alaska."
"Together with our industry partners, we’ve invested millions of dollars in marketing efforts that saved many businesses in 2021 and will revitalize this pillar of our economy in 2022, and for many years to come."
Our mining sector is poised to supply our nation and the world with the critical minerals we need for national security and cleaner forms of energy and transportation.
"Compared to the dire predictions at the onset of this pandemic, our health care system has surprised many with its resiliency and resourcefulness."
"As of today, 1,039 of our fellow Alaskans have unfortunately passed away with COVID-19."
"We mourn their loss, and our hearts go out to their loved ones."
"At the same time, of the more than 194,000 cases we’ve identified, nearly 99.5 percent of our fellow Alaskans have survived this infection, and for that we are immensely thankful."
"While we battled the delta variant surge this past fall, our staffing shortfalls for medical professionals was of grave concern to all of us."
My administration acted last August before the surge fully hit when we took decisive action after receiving a notification that health care workers were available.
"We consulted with the state hospital association to identify their needs, and secured nearly 500 contract professionals covering specialties from nurses to respiratory therapists."
"After finalizing the contract in September, it took less than a month for us to deploy these workers around the state to our hospitals, nursing homes, and the Department of Corrections just in time to deal with the surge."
"Again, good policies and decisive action can make all the difference."
"We brought the needed resources to bear to reinforce our hospitals, but we recognize temporary workers are not a long-term solution."
We now have three initiatives to address the shortages we’ve identified in our health care workforce.
"First, we’re working with the Board of Nursing and the state hospital association to recruit and retain over 600 Certified Nursing Assistants."
This is a huge accomplishment achieved in a very short amount of time to boost our health care workforce for the long-term.
"Second, we’ve issued a $2.1 million grant to the University of Alaska Anchorage Nursing School to recruit and retain additional faculty to train and graduate more registered nurses."
"Third, my administration’s FY23 budget includes a 50 percent increase to the number of students in the WWAMI program."
"If approved by the Legislature, we’ll go from 20 seats to 30 seats at the University of Washington School of Medicine to train doctors to work in Alaska."
"Together with these partners, we’ll build a stronger, more durable health care system in Alaska that can respond to most any situation."
"Every state, every nation, has been confronted with this pandemic, and its periodic surges as new variants emerge."
"But make no mistake about it, we’ve been very different from many others in how we’ve responded, and our outcomes prove it!We’ve led on testing."
We’ve led on vaccine distribution.
We’ve led on the distribution of therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies as the first state to establish a community site to receive treatment.
"We recognized early on that specific populations were more vulnerable to this virus than others, particularly our elders, those with underlying health issues, and some residents of our remote communities with limited health care infrastructure."
"From the beginning, I was determined that there would be no repeat of 1918 on my watch here in Alaska."
"By any measure, history will reflect that our actions helped us achieve some of the best outcomes in the nation."
"The data speaks for itself, and it’s irrefutable."
We’ll also continue to lead on protecting Alaskans’ medical freedoms.
My administration will continue to defend Alaskans’ rights to make their own medical decisions about vaccines and therapeutics for themselves and their families in consultation with their doctors and pharmacists.
It’s not the State’s job to make those decisions for you.
My administration’s job is to make sure our health care system is strong and you have the tools available to take care of yourself.
"What we’ve learned about this virus is that it impacts certain groups more than others, that inevitably it will continue to mutate into new variants, and that it will most likely be with us for a very long time, if not forever."
We’ve learned with the latest variant that it won’t be vaccinated away.
"As a result, we need to live with it and incorporate it into our daily lives.We cannot simply exist.We can’t run away from life.We must live without fear."
"Fear is not a substitute for knowledge, and what we’ve learned about this virus allows us to move forward and get on with our lives."
"While we’ve had to respond to this virus, an effective public health policy is not just about one disease."
An effective public health policy must include all aspects of health: physical; mental; spiritual; educational; and economic well-being.
Mental health is a critical issue in Alaska as we all know.
We remember the dire situation my administration was handed at the Alaska Psychiatric Institute at the beginning of my term.
"API was in such disarray that it was in danger of losing its certification and its ability to receive federal funds, but, most importantly, its ability to serve Alaskans."
One of the promises I made when I ran for this office was to ensure that government works for the people.
"Thanks to our Health Department, we turned that situation around."
"From a low of 20 staffed beds soon after I took office, we now have more than 55 staffed beds."
The crisis was so bad at API in the winter of 2018 that it led to a halt in admissions for the unit that serves adolescents in crisis.
"I’m glad to report today that we have reopened the unit, we now have seven staffed beds, and are continuing to build up its capacity."
My administration has added mental and behavioral health resources to our Pioneer Homes and our Department of Corrections as well.
"By focusing on effective policies, Alaska is now situated to provide the right care at the right time to our families, friends, and neighbors."
Making sure government works for Alaskans wasn’t the only promise I made three years ago.
"I also pledged that we would live within our means, that we would make government more efficient, and we would find reductions before we ever asked Alaskans to be taxed.We’ve done this."
My proposed budget for state spending in the next fiscal year is 7 percent less than the 2019 budget in place when I took office.
"Because of our insistence on being as efficient as possible, and with an improved revenue situation compared to when I first took office, we’re funding the core services that Alaskans expect."
"Three years ago, from this chamber, and throughout my time in office, I have pledged to fight for the PFD."
Fighting for Alaskans’ share of our resource wealth will always be a top priority of mine.
"I’ve asked the Legislature to follow the statutory formula, and if these bodies will no longer follow that law, they should change the law with the approval of Alaskans."
"Year after year, I’ve offered the Legislature solutions that I believed would honor Alaskans and solve this issue for the long-term.Isn’t that why we’re here?"
To honor the people who sent us here and work on their behalf?
Our purpose is to be servants of the people.
I agree with former Governor Jay Hammond that the government should never take more from the Permanent Fund than is distributed to the people of Alaska.
"To break through the gridlock that has paralyzed the Legislature since the PFD was first vetoed in 2016, I’ve offered a plan that would protect the PFD in the constitution for generations to come, and would give the people a say in how their PFD is determined."
"The Permanent Fund was created by the people, for the people, and the people must have a voice in the future of their PFD."
"Keep in mind, the government’s finances are doing quite well.This is great news."
"However, our focus must be on how well our fellow Alaskans are doing."
Inflation is now at a 40-year high!
The price of everything is going through the roof.
"Inflation is eating away paychecks faster than wages are rising for most Americans and Alaskans.Yet, Alaska is fortunate."
The Permanent Fund is the envy of every state in the country.
Now is the perfect time to settle this issue for Alaskans during this critical period.
The people of Alaska must not be an afterthought!
They must be foremost in every decision we make.
"There are a lot of lobbyists who come to Juneau to argue for a bigger piece of the pie for their clients from the Permanent Fund, but, as I’ve often said, my job is to represent Alaskans who don’t have lobbyists.That’s not just my job.That’s your job as well."
"We can’t forget why we’re here, and who sent us here."
Everyday Alaskans who play by the rules and follow the law are wondering how the people they’ve given the power to make laws can excuse themselves from following those very laws when it appears to be inconvenient.
They’re wondering how we’ve come to a place where the PFD is nothing more than what’s left over after government takes the lion’s share.
They’re wondering how we’ve reached a place where the last Permanent Fund Dividend wasn’t even paid for from the Permanent Fund.
These everyday Alaskans have watched the Permanent Fund boom over the past two years thanks to a record run in the stock markets and they wonder why they’ve been left behind.
"Just two years ago, the Permanent Fund was worth $65 billion, and today it is worth $82 billion."
"But as we know, stock market gains do not equally benefit everyone."
"Working and middle class Alaskans and their fellow Americans have struggled to keep their paychecks, or keep their businesses open for the past two years."
"At the same time, we’ve witnessed the largest transfer of wealth to the top 1 percent in the history of mankind."
"Under our constitution, the people of Alaska are the resource owners."
"Under our constitution, they are owed their share of this wealth."
"I will continue calling upon the Legislature to either follow the law, or change the law with the consent of the people."
Settling this issue can’t be avoided any longer.
Let us write the history that this was the year we all came together to find a solution once and for all.
Another pledge I made to Alaskans as I stood here three years ago was to promote economic growth and opportunity.
"As 2019 ended, we had finally clawed out of a multi-year recession."
Our GDP was growing as fast or faster than all but seven of our fellow states; our unemployment rate continued to reach record lows.
But we all know what happened next as we entered 2020.
The economic devastation hit Alaska like no other state.
"Nearly overnight we lost more than 42,000 jobs."
"We are still a long way from recovering the jobs lost in 2020, but we are moving in the right direction."
Oil production has rebounded from the industry cuts at the onset of the pandemic.
"Back in 2013, after years averaging 6 percent annual production declines, the forecast for production in the current fiscal year was projected to be just 340,000 barrels per day."
"Instead, we are in fact, around 500,000 barrels, with multiple large projects in development and billions of barrels still in the ground."
"If allowed to come to fruition, these projects can add more than 300,000 barrels per day in production."
"Ten years ago, some had the idea that policy didn’t matter, that the oil was running out and the decline was inevitable."
There was basically nothing we could do.
"Today, our production numbers prove that good policy that encourages business works."
"At the same time, our ability to increase production is under attack from Washington, DC, and federal courts that side with extremist environmental groups."
No state has been targeted more by the current administration than our Great State of Alaska.
"At every turn and since day one of the Biden Administration, this hostility has been perfectly clear."
"They don’t care about Alaska, and they don’t care about you."
"Out of all 50 states, we are the only state that was specifically admitted to the Union compelled to support ourselves through the development of our rich natural resources."
"For those who want us to invest in programs such as renewables, as I do, the cost of transition can only come from the revenue from our oil and gas."
"From that perspective, the policies coming from Washington DC make absolutely no sense and, quite frankly border on insanity.Why do I say that?"
Because no president should have to beg for more oil from the Middle East or Russia’s Arctic when we can produce it right here better and safer than anywhere else on the planet!This is common sense!
"This misguided policy only caters to extremists in the environmental movement, and strangely, to the leaders of countries that are not our friends."
"Folks, our enemies are laughing all the way to the bank."
This is why my administration’s Statehood Defense Initiative is vital to protect Alaska from these crazy policies.
I will not stand idly by and allow Washington to throttle Alaska’s future without a fight .
and I thank the Legislature for standing with my administration and the people of Alaska by funding this effort.
We must be allowed to fulfill the promises made in the Statehood Act to support ourselves with resource development!
"Along with increased oil production, another bright spot this past year was a record run of 63 million sockeye salmon in Bristol Bay."
"The state salmon harvest overall was valued at $644 million, the third-best ever."
"But we also know that some salmon returns across the state set different records, unfortunately, for all-time lows, particularly in many parts of Western Alaska."
"In conjunction with local and industry partners, we secured tens of thousands of pounds of salmon for the impacted villages."
"At the same time, we know this isn’t a solution for Alaskans who have survived off their lands and waters for thousands of years."
The issue of bycatch has long been a contentious one.
"To help solve this longstanding issue, my administration has created a Bycatch Review Task Force that will take in all the science and data to ascertain causes and then put forth recommendations to solve this issue for the benefit of Alaskans."
"We know that natural forces cause ups and downs in wildlife populations, but we must understand the causes of population declines and the possible manmade effects from other fisheries in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska."
"Every possible impact must be examined, and we must make sure our valuable species such as salmon, crab, and halibut are protected."
"As we all know, the main purpose of government is to provide security for its citizens first and foremost, and that includes food security."
This is an area we are proposing further initiatives to boost our agriculture and mariculture industries.
"As a state disconnected from the Lower 48, at the top of the world with a small population, we are at the start and the end of the supply chain and too often at the mercy of others for our state’s survival."
What we’ve seen at backed up ports around the country powerfully illustrates how fragile that supply chain can be.
"Whether caused by a natural disaster or a port closure, Alaskans are well aware of how a disruption in the supply chain can affect us."
It’s often noted that Alaska’s grocery stores only have about two weeks’ worth of food in stock.
"At the onset of the pandemic, and more recently, we’ve seen some empty shelves in Alaska."
"The key component of a modern state is the ability to produce what it needs to ensure its survival, and that means we must build our own supply chain."
That is where our Alaska Grown businesses have a huge part to play.
"Because, and make no mistake, at some future date, there will be another disruption to our supply chain."
We must be prepared for that inevitability.We must be self-sufficient.
"Through our Pioneer Homes, our Department of Corrections, our schools, and more, the State of Alaska can be the biggest supporter of our Alaska Grown products to ensure our agriculture, mariculture, and food processing industries have the level of business they need to sustain and expand, and to be there when we need them!"
"Soon, we will be introducing legislation and an Administrative Order creating a Food Security Task Force in support of this effort."
"Food security starts with land, and Alaska has more farmland potential than any other state."
"In Texas, more than 95 percent of the land is privately-owned."
"But in Alaska, the biggest state in the country by far, we have barely 4 percent of our land in private hands.This must change."
"We often rail against the federal government that holds so much of our land, yet as a state we hoard our own land like no other.This makes no sense."
"To increase our agricultural production, and to make the Alaska dream of owning a piece of the Last Frontier attainable, we must have land reform."
"We introduced several bills last year that would facilitate the goals of growing an agriculture sector, and make land easier for Alaskans to acquire as well."
But we need these bills to move to make this happen.
"Our constitution demands that we encourage the settlement of our land, and the development of our resources by making them available for maximum use."
I call upon the Legislature to act upon these land bills.
We must meet our responsibilities under the constitution and to give Alaskans a piece of the Last Frontier.
"Over the past several years as we’ve faced multi-billion-dollar deficits, we’ve been forced to have a debate about how much the state spends and how we should prioritize that spending."
But where there can be no debate is that the Number One job of any government is public safety.
"When I took office, the Department of Public Safety, our brave State Troopers, and Village Public Safety Officers had been weakened through years of budget cuts."
"In 2016, the State Troopers had lost 38 positions in just two years, posts were being closed around the state, and our services to rural Alaskans were being shortchanged as well."
"While restraining state spending elsewhere, my administration has proposed four years of increased resources for the Department of Public Safety, and I thank the Legislature for supporting these efforts."
We now have 20 more funded Trooper positions than when I took office.
We’re on track for two full Public Safety academies in 2022 that could add as many as 60 Troopers to our ranks.
We’ve added dedicated major crimes investigators to Western Alaska for the first time.
These new resources will be a game-changer.
"Four of those investigators are now based in Bethel, where we are adding a deputy fire marshal and a crime scene technician as well."
One of our outstanding State Troopers is also based in Bethel.
Sergeant Elondre Johnson is an 18-year veteran of the State Troopers assigned to the Bethel Post.
"Over the years, Sergeant Johnson has developed an impeccable reputation and positive relationships with the communities he serves."
Sergeant Johnson serves the villages of the Y-K Delta where he also helps train local law enforcement and new Troopers assigned to the Bethel Post.
"Sergeant Johnson has won praise from stakeholder groups, residents of the communities he serves, survivors, and the local District Attorney’s office."
The local District Attorney cites his high caliber case work as essential for successful prosecution of serious crimes.
"Serving rural Alaska is the primary mission of the State Troopers, and Sergeant Johnson puts that mission into practice every day in harmony with his division’s purpose of “Public Safety through Public Service."
"In recognition of his outstanding service and his model example to fellow Troopers, Sergeant Johnson was named the 2020 Alaska State Trooper of the Year."
"We are fortunate that he is here tonight, so please, Sergeant Johnson, could you stand to be recognized?"
We are so grateful for the service and sacrifice you and your fellow Troopers are giving Alaska every day.
I assure you it does not go unnoticed.
"Again, I want to thank you, Sergeant Johnson, for your service to Alaska."
"In furtherance of our goals to revitalize service to rural Alaska, we’ve authorized pay increases for Village Public Safety Officers, and we’ve hired 22-year Trooper veteran Colonel Joel Hard to take over the new position of VPSO Operations Director."
"Thanks to previous funding from the Legislature, we’ve finally cleared the decades-old backlog of thousands of untested sexual assault examination kits!"
"We must never let such a backlog happen again, and we’ve put into place the personnel and policies to make sure it won’t."
"In the bill that repealed SB 91, another provision was added to require all kits to be examined within one year."
"My administration knows we can do much better, so we’ve tasked the Crime Lab to complete these examinations in less than 90 days."
I also appreciate the Legislature approving my funding request for 10 Department of Corrections personnel to take on another decades-old problem of collecting DNA from those arrested or convicted for certain crimes.
"We’re making great strides with legislative support for funding this important program, and I thank you all for that."
Good things really can happen when we work together.
"These programs will not only aid us in providing swift justice for victims, but are also helping us resolve cold cases to bring long-overdue justice for victims and their families."
"Justice delayed is justice denied, and I thank the court system for resuming criminal jury trials to protect the rights of victims and the rights of the accused."
"My proposed budget also funds additional criminal prosecutors to clear the case backlog brought on by this pandemic, and it includes court system funding to resume the five-day work week."
"Tonight, I’m asking you, the Legislature, to fund my proposed DPS budget for the next fiscal year that supports the People First Initiative."
The good news for Alaska is that our overall crime rate has declined significantly in the past couple years; the bad news is that our rates of domestic violence and sexual assault remain stubbornly high.
"As we announced last month, the People First initiative is the umbrella for five distinct initiatives addressing our most critical problems that impact our most vulnerable: domestic violence and sexual assault human trafficking missing and murdered Indigenous persons the foster care system and homelessness."
These are not top-down proposals.
They’ve been crafted from the ground up based upon the input of multiple stakeholders in a process that started in November of 2020.
"The People First Initiative is a mix of statutory changes, additional personnel, administrative orders, technology, and increased resources to tackle these longstanding, serious problems."
These issues are not necessarily new.
"Many of them have been with us for so long that they’ve almost been normalized in Alaska, as almost unsolvable."
My administration cannot – it will not – accept these tragic outcomes as beyond our control.
"We owe Alaskans, especially our most vulnerable, to do nothing less than everything in our power to break these vicious cycles of violence, of abuse, of despair."
Carley Rose Kelly is an example of a survivor who is breaking these cycles.
"Carley has survived domestic violence and drug addiction, but it wasn’t easy."
"After losing custody of her children, she turned to drugs to numb the pain."
She has had run-ins with the law; she chose unhealthy relationships; she became homeless.
"After years of struggle, she was able to pull her life together."
"Today, at the age of 27, she is nearly three years sober."
She is a Client Navigator and Peer Support Specialist for at-risk and homeless youth at My House in Wasilla.
She is in a healthy marriage and is reconnecting with her children.
One part of the People First Initiative that Carly is most enthusiastic about is the “through one door” concept we’ll be implementing at the Alaska Family Justice Center.
"Carley knows about the need for victims to feel safe, to not have to go to multiple sites to address their emergency medical, housing, legal, and children’s needs."
"She can see the benefit of being able to connect with a case manager and tell their story once, and receive immediate assistance."
Carley knows how easily victims get lost in the shuffle .
"she knows the challenges of transportation, and how quickly victims “give up” in the process of seeking help because they have to deal with a disjointed, bureaucratic system."
"Carley firmly believes had this type of approach existed during her darkest hours, she would have been in recovery sooner and had a better chance of maintaining custody of her children."
These are the types of approaches we’ll be implementing under the People First Initiative thanks to the input from survivors like Carley.
"Carley is here tonight, and, Carley, I congratulate you on your recovery and your commitment to others."
"Carley, could you please stand and be recognized?"
"Thank you for the example you’re setting, Carley, and for all you’re doing at My House."
The People First Initiative will be critical for our fellow Alaskans who are experiencing what Carley has gone through.
"With innovative approaches such as the “through one door” concept, we are determined to provide the assistance to Alaskans that Carley struggled to find."
I look forward to working with the Legislature and stakeholder groups to put this into action.
"As we begin this second half of the 32nd Legislative Session, there are some who believe nothing will get done because it’s an election year.Let’s prove them wrong!"
"We must remember that other than pink salmon fishermen, most Alaskans don’t care whether it is an odd- or even-numbered year."
Most Alaskans outside this room don’t plan their lives around an election season.
"They plan their lives around hunting season, or fishing season; construction season, or tourism season.But not election season."
Alaskans won’t accept that we can’t get anything done because it’s an election year.
"Because I’m an eternal optimist, I still believe we can bring out the best in each other."
"We can never lose sight of the future, and we certainly cannot lose sight of why the people of Alaska sent us all here."
"We need to work on the Alaska, not of yesterday, but of the next 5, 10, and 50 years.That Alaska starts now."
Our motto isn’t “North to the Next Election” or “North to Gridlock.
Our motto is “North to the Future.
What does that future look like to you?
I envision an Alaska where our people and our most vulnerable feel safer tomorrow than they did yesterday.
I envision an Alaska where our privacy and our freedom of speech are secure.
No Alaskan should fear the IRS snooping around their bank account.
No parent should fear speaking up lest they be targeted as a potential domestic terrorist.
I will always stand between Alaskans and a federal government that violates our God-given rights and exceeds its constitutional authority.
"I envision an Alaska where our educational outcomes are the best in the nation, not the worst."
"As a teacher, a superintendent, and a School Board member, education has been a lifelong passion for me."
"When I pursued my master’s degree at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, I chose the track of cross-cultural education so I could be a more effective teacher in rural Alaska."
"I worked in education in rural Alaska for nearly 20 years, and I know firsthand the challenges for students both on and off the road system."
"My proposed budget fully funds education, school bond debt reimbursement, and University scholarships, but I have long said that we must be focused more on outputs than inputs."
"I will continue to work with our Department of Education, Commissioner Johnson, and the Legislature to improve our education system."
We must ensure that our children are attaining the benchmark skills in reading and math that will set them on a course for success no matter what career they choose.
I have always envisioned an Alaska where parents are the most crucial component in the educational success of their children.
"This is why I’ve supported our public schools, home schools, charter schools, and other schools of choice."
"Years ago, when I was a Senator, I and other legislators passed a Parental Rights bill that recognizes parents as the most essential part of their children’s education."
I envision an Alaska where parents and children are .and remain .
"at the forefront of every educational decision we make, and I will continue to protect the rights of parents in the education of their children."
"I also envision an Alaska that is energy independent and a leader in renewable energy whether it be hydro, tidal, geothermal, wind, solar, or other."
"I envision an Alaska where we finally get our stranded natural gas off the North Slope and into our homes and businesses, and around the world."
"With key permits in hand and a federal loan guarantee in place, we are closer now than ever to making this gasline a reality."
"I envision an Alaska where our cost of energy is no longer the second-highest in the nation, but one of the lowest.That’s my vision.I hope it is yours as well."
"Since the 2019 fiscal year, the Alaska Energy Authority has completed projects that have replaced more than 7.6 million gallons of diesel fuel per year."
"We have abundant renewable resource potential, and we can turn that potential into a reality that will lower costs for all Alaskans, and invite industries to invest in our Great State as well."
The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System has operated for nearly 45 years as the backbone of our economy.
It has transformed Alaska into the modern state that it is.
"The pipeline provides energy, revenue, and jobs for our state, and it provides national security for the United States as well."
"I envision an Alaska that remains an oil and gas giant with a pipeline that operates for at least another 45 years to underwrite the cost of government, our renewable potential, and secure our energy independence."
I envision an Alaska that is connected to the digital world through high-speed broadband that unlocks the opportunity for us to live anywhere and work from anywhere in this Great State.
"I envision an Alaska that is a worldwide leader in technology, in unmanned aircraft systems, and in the critical minerals needed to power the technology of today and tomorrow."
The University of Alaska is central to this future in my proposed budget.
I envision an Alaska that capitalizes on our proximity to the rest of the globe; an Alaska that is the U. S. port to Asia; an Alaska that continues to anchor America’s national security as host to our military bases.
"The Alaska I see in the future is self-sufficient and secure in its energy, its food supply, and other critical sectors; an Alaska that is healthier and safer; an Alaska that is prosperous with opportunities for all."
"I envision an Alaska where its major port systems are not only structurally sound, but are designed to handle a growing economy for the next 10, 50, and 100 years."
I envision an Alaska that is prepared for every opportunity.
"An open Arctic supporting transocean shipments from the Atlantic to the Pacific could make Alaska “the Panama of the north” and create more jobs, more wealth, and more opportunity for future Alaskans."
"Over the holidays, I had a chance to take a walk with two of my daughters, Catherine and Maggie, and our three dogs Blue, Olive and Mr. Tito, and I asked them what they see for Alaska’s future."
"“Dad,” Catherine said, “Alaska has so much to offer."
I can’t think of anywhere I’d rather be.I love the outdoors.
I will have the opportunity to work at a great job.
My family is here and I only see upside.
"Sure, I can visit somewhere else, but this is my home."
"As many of you know, all three of my daughters are shareholders of the NANA Corporation, Tribal members, and work at the Red Dog Mine located in the region where they were born and spent much of their childhood."
"I met their mom, Rose, in Nome, and we were married there 34 years ago."
"Our First Lady is from Noorvik, a village on the Kobuk River, and through the Red Dog mine, she has seen firsthand how economic opportunity and jobs transformed the region for the better."
"When I asked her what she envisions for the future of the state, she told me she wants those same opportunities she had .for everyone else."
"She would tell you no one should be left behind, urban or rural, regardless of race or background."
"Without economic opportunity, without safety, without good schools, the next generation of Alaskans may look South."
“North to the Future” will be a hollow motto without opportunity for our kids and grandkids.
It will merely be a bumper sticker on a car crossing the Canadian border never to return.
It will be a destiny gone unfulfilled.
The power to fulfill this destiny is in this room tonight .It’s in our hands.
"Together, we can make sure that the next generation doesn’t look South to find its opportunities and its dreams."
We can make sure it is truly the future that the next generation sees when they look North to the Great State of Alaska.
Those of us here tonight have a great obligation to come together around policies that will solve long-standing issues and create those opportunities for generations to come.The future is now.
"We can’t dwell on yesterday, and we’re running out of tomorrows."
"So let’s get to work, and let’s work together."
I want to thank you again for the opportunity to speak to you tonight.
"May God bless you all, and may God continue to bless the Great State of Alaska.Thank you."
"One traditionally begins a State of the State address by acknowledging dignitaries here in the chamber, but this morning calls for something a little different."
I want to first acknowledge the people who couldn’t be here.
"Please join me in a moment of silence for Coloradans who have lost their lives: to COVID, to violence, and to natural disasters including the recent Boulder County fires."
"Now, To the legislative leadership in both parties Members of the General Assembly, Lieutenant Governor Primavera, Treasurer Young Attorney General Weiser, Our dedicated First Gentleman Reis, Mayor Hancock Mayor Coffman Members of the State Board of Education, Justices of the Colorado Supreme Court, Members of the Cabinet, Welcome."
"I appreciate and value your presence here today, and I look forward to all the good work we will do in the days and weeks ahead on behalf of the people of Colorado."
We are so privileged to represent you.
"My Fellow Coloradans, I want to begin today with gratitude."
"Gratitude for the people of Colorado, who have shown-up, day after day, in the face of trauma and under the most difficult circumstances, to help one another, to help OUR Colorado."
Gratitude for the individuals who set aside their own personal challenges to support the needs of our community.
"Gratitude for my colleagues in this chamber who have put Coloradans first, no matter what."
"And gratitude, of course, for my family."
"Marlon, I want to thank you for being here today and everyday for me and our family."
"Gratitude for my staff, who continue working in service to our great state through thick and thin."
"While this pandemic has made even the most mundane activities risky, we have not endured the virus alone."
Evil acts against innocent people in the places where we once ran errands or recreated have also made us feel less safe.
"We have feared the ever changing nature of the virus, wondering if what protected us yesterday will protect us today."
We learned that the words ‘fire season’ don’t apply when the most destructive fire in Colorado history happens on December 30th.
"And we were reminded, once more, that our lives, and everything we hold dear, can go up in flames in an instant.Yet, hope shines through.Hope."
I know how easy it is to get lost in the pain and sadness of what we’ve all endured together.
"But no matter how tough this year has been, I know for a fact that Coloradans are fundamentally good, we care for one another and we are tougher than anything thrown our way.I’ve seen it myself."
"I’ve seen it in the students of Central High School in Mesa County, who, with the help of school staff, stood up a series of vaccination clinics before many of them were even eligible to get vaccinated, working 10 to 11 hour days to get more than 1,300 community members vaccinated."
"Mesa County Valley District 51 Assistant Superintendent Brian Hill, and school staff Kim Flynn and Trey Downey are here with us today.Please stand."
You are remarkable role models for the students you help educate.
I’ve seen it in the men and women on the frontlines of this pandemic who have helped us achieve one of the shortest shutdowns and one of the lowest death rates in the country.
"Thank you to Colorado’s COVID Response Team led by Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment Director Jill Ryan; Public Safety Director Stan Hilkey; and, COVID-19 Incident Commander, Scott Bookman; our team of experts and scientists, our local public health officials working on the ground in their communities; national guard members who have spent the last 672 consecutive days supporting Colorado’s pandemic response by staffing our testing sites and helping distribute vaccines, critical workers and staff in Colorado’s 24/7 facilities, and of course the heroic nurses, doctors, and health care providers who have never stopped putting their patients first."
Politicians talk about improving lives.You actually save lives.
Please stand and let us recognize you.
I’ve seen it in the individuals and businesses who collectively donated more than $20 Million to support their fellow Coloradans who had homes damaged or destroyed by the Boulder County fire.
"I’ve seen it in Boulder Sheriff Joe Pelle and his team, and the firefighters and emergency responders, who sprung into action to save the lives and homes of their neighbors, even when they didn’t know whether their own homes were still standing."
"We’re joined by Sheriff Pelle, who, for the last 18 years, has led my hometown community of Boulder County through countless natural disasters and emergencies."
"Sheriff Pelle, firefighters, and emergency responders, please stand so we can thank you for the lifesaving work that you do every day."
"I saw it in Lakewood Police Officer Ashley Ferris, who was injured in crossfire with the perpetrator of the heinous attacks across Denver and Lakewood."
"Still, she found the strength to take down the shooter, ending his violent killing spree and saving many precious lives."
"She couldn't join us today, but we wish Officer Ferris a speedy recovery."
Please join me in thanking her.
"And I saw it in Boulder Officer Eric Talley and Arvada Officer Gordon Beesley, who both braved active shooter situations to save the lives of their fellow community members, even though it meant ultimately losing their own."
They have our everlasting gratitude.This is the Colorado spirit.
"These men and women define who we are as a people, and represent the very best of us."
"There are so many other stories like theirs, of everyday people doing their best and giving everything to protect our Colorado."
"It feels like every time we turn on the news, all we see is partisanship, polarization and division.Division across the country.Division in Congress."
"But not here; not in Colorado, where we set aside our differences, and come together to do what is right.It’s just who we are."
No one political party has a monopoly on good ideas or love of country.
"I am proud to be joined today by my friend and former Treasurer, Walker Stapleton, who I recently appointed to the Economic Development Commission."
"I appointed Walker because I know how much he loves this state, and Colorado will benefit from his talent and business savvy, just as the General Assembly will benefit from Speaker Garnett’s appointment of Representative Marc Catlin as vice chair of the House Agriculture Committee."
"This isn’t my Colorado or your Colorado, this is our Colorado – which is why we respond together, we heal together, we move forward together, and we succeed together."
"It’s why, in spite of all we have faced this last year, I count it the greatest honor of my life to serve as your Governor, and am hopeful as ever about the promise of our Colorado."
"It’s up to us here in this chamber to continue doing everything in our power to protect the way of life we cherish in our state, and build on our accomplishments of the last year."
"When I stood before you all last February, I described a vision for the future of our state."
A future where every child can get the education they deserve.
"A future where a dynamic, multi-modal transportation system meets the needs of our growing population."
"A future where access to affordable and quality health care is a given, not an aspiration."
A future where we protect and invest in the public lands and parks that make Colorado beautiful by building a clean energy economy.
"A future where our people and our communities aren't just getting by, but thriving."
That future was more than just a dream; it was a call to action -- a challenge for us all to live up to this shared vision of our state.
"I'm proud that in spite of the many difficulties we have weathered, that vision is within reach, thanks to the hard work of this legislative body and our shared commitment to deliver for Coloradans."
I want to take a moment to recognize the best partners a Governor could ask for in the two gentlemen sitting behind me.
"In these unprecedented times, we may not agree on everything, but our unwavering, mutual commitment to the success of all Coloradans and our beautiful state is the rock solid foundation upon which we’ve built a lasting partnership rooted in trust."
I want to express my heartfelt thanks to Speaker Alec Garnett and President Leroy Garcia in their last legislative session for their service to the people of our state.
"And to House Majority Leader Esgar, who is also starting her last session, thank you for your partnership, and tireless advocacy on behalf of Pueblo and all our hard working state employees."
"To Senator Holbert, thank you for the dialogue and bipartisan collaboration, and for your steady leadership for Douglas County."
"Finally, to Senator Fenberg and Representative McKean, if you want a shout-out like this, you’d better stay put for another couple more years."
"Just as we’ve stepped up to meet what has often felt like a never-ending onslaught of disasters and challenges, we have the opportunity to respond with that same resolve and urgency to the day-to-day crises Coloradans are facing."
"Because of this pandemic, the cost of living in our fair state continues to escalate, and Coloradans are desperate for relief.So let’s deliver."
We must double down on our promise to help every business and family succeed.
"That means taking less of your hard-earned money in fees and taxes, and putting more in your pockets and paychecks."
Inflation has accelerated during the pandemic.
Supply chains have been disrupted.Spending habits have changed.
The cost of housing has spiked.
"Farmers and ranchers face unprecedented losses, and many Coloradans have left the workforce."
Too many people are struggling to make ends meet.
"As your Governor, I want you to know: we hear you and we are here to do something about it."
"While all of these complex problems can’t be solved overnight, we promise to use every single tool at our disposal to save hardworking Coloradans the money you need to live the life you want."
"In one of his most popular songs, legendary songwriter Paul Simon sings of 50 ways."
"You just slip out the back, Jack Make a new plan, Stan You don't need to be coy, Roy Just get yourself free Now, I’m no Paul Simon, or even Vice President Selina Meyer, but in the year ahead, I’ll be pushing for MORE than 50 ways to save Coloradans money."
"I don’t have a knack for rhyming or a voice to sing, what I CAN promise is that the work we do here will save Coloradans money."
"My version of Simon’s lyrics goes a little something like this: “Just cut the tax, Max; lower the rate, Nate; you don’t need to pay more, Thor; just send your kids for free (to preschool and kindergarten) This isn’t a new idea for my administration, in fact it’s been hard-wired into our DNA from day one."
"In my first weeks in office, we created the Office of Saving People Money on Health Care, which–in collaboration with legislators and healthcare providers--has resulted in nation- leading efforts to reduce health care costs."
"Thanks to the efforts of Representatives McCluskie, Representative Rich, Senator Donovan, and Senator Rankin, we created a reinsurance program which has reduced health care premiums on the individual market by 24%, saving hardworking Coloradans an average of $1,400 this year statewide, and an average of $2,450 per year in Western Colorado, one of the highest cost markets."
"With the tireless commitment of Senator Donovan, Representative Jodeh, and Representative Roberts, we created a first-in-the-country insurance model that will save money for everyone who buys insurance on the individual or small group markets."
"And thanks to the leadership of Representative Roberts, we are capping the skyrocketing cost of insulin at $100 per month."
"After years of advocacy by members of this body, including former Representative Wilson, current Representative McLachlan and Senators Bridges and Fields, the General Assembly passed free, full-day kindergarten, saving families up to $4,800 – and giving our youngest Coloradans a fantastic start in life."
"With Speaker Garnett, Representative Sirota, Senate Majority Leader Fenberg, and Senator Buckner leading the way, we’re focused on implementing free, universal preschool by 2023, saving even more money for young families with an average $4,300 in savings per family."
"Health care and education are where Coloradans face some of the highest costs, but we know they aren’t the only pain points."
"That’s why we’ve also implemented historic tax relief, helping Coloradans keep more of what they earn."
"We funded the Colorado Child Tax Credit for the first time in history, giving families with children under age six up to $1,080 per year per child."
"We also doubled the state Earned Income Tax Credit, giving workers up to $1,495 per year."
"We cut taxes for retirees by exempting social security earnings from the state income tax, saving seniors up to $654 per year."
"Voters also approved reductions to the Colorado income tax rate, which is saving families about $100 per year on average, while helping businesses hire more and pay more."
"And because we in this chamber are not only committed to saving Coloradans money, but to doing it in a way that ensures continued access to critical state services, we fully paid for the tax cuts by reducing lobbyist loopholes and special interest tax giveaways for the wealthy and well-connected."
"And I want to thank Senator Dominic Moreno, Senator Chris Hansen, and Representatives Sirota and Weissman for their leadership on this bold tax reform package that is already saving people money."
"Because our revenues are strong, families will also receive a tax refund of $74 on average this year, and about $440 on average next year, along with another income tax rate cut of 1.1%."
"We also cut property taxes for farms, ranches, renewable energy projects, and homes, and next year, we will start letting every homeowner defer increases on their property taxes, ensuring they won’t ever have to pay a tax bill they can’t afford."
Thank you Treasurer Young for your leadership in protecting families from rising property tax bills.
"My administration will work with both parties to continue cutting taxes and fees wherever we can, but never at the expense of teachers and law enforcement We took bipartisan action in 2020 and again in 2021, allowing restaurants and bars to keep their sales taxes during the pandemic!"
"Thank you to Representatives Van Winkle, Valdez, and Mullica, and Senators Bridges, Pettersen, Woodward, and former Senator Tate."
"In our commitment to help support our local economies, our tax reform package permanently exempted small businesses from the business personal property tax, meaning real savings in time and money for nearly every main street business."
"Businesses like The Smiling Pig restaurant in Park County, owned by Tim Gregg, will save more than $1,000 a year thanks to these policies."
"We’re joined today by Tim, and Park County Assessor Monica Jones."
Please join me in welcoming them.
"To keep costs down for entrepreneurs like Tim and so many others, I’m proposing that we further reduce fees like the unemployment insurance premium and the Paid Family and Medical Leave premium, resulting in hundreds of millions in savings for the businesses and workers that power our economy."
"And while we’re at it, to foster our entrepreneurial spirit, we should make it free for Coloradans to start their own business."
"I look forward to working with Secretary of State Jena Griswold, Representatives Cutter and Sullivan, and Senators Pettersen and Kolker on this effort."
"Last year, Majority Leader Fenberg, Senator Donovan and Representatives Will and Tipper brought us the innovative Keep Colorado Wild Pass, cutting the cost of an annual pass to state parks by more than half, saving the average family more than $40."
"With this pass, everyone can enjoy our treasured public lands for less – including our newest state parks at Fishers Peak and Sweetwater Lake, while increasing the resources to care for these lands."
"Thanks to CDOT Director Shoshana Lew, a bipartisan coalition of legislators, and local leaders, including Mayor Suthers and Mayor Coffman, we passed historic transportation reform."
"Spearheaded by Senator Faith Winter, Senate Majority Leader Fenberg, Speaker Garnett and Representative Matt Gray, we cut vehicle registration fees, saving people money, while making record investments in our rural roads, and new ways to transport people, goods, and services that will save Coloradans time and money, and put our state on a pathway to a cleaner, more sustainable transportation system."
We are finally going to fix the darn roads.
"Looking to the year ahead, I am excited that, with the leadership of Representatives Ortiz and Young, and Senators Fields and Kolker, we are doubling down on our efforts to cut costs for Coloradans by preventing increases in drivers’ license fees, and I look forward to efforts to reduce vehicle registration fees."
"We’ve lowered housing costs by funding more than 14,000 units of affordable housing in the last year, saving families more than $72 million annually.And we are ready to do more."
Rising housing costs are pricing people out of neighborhoods they’ve lived in for years.
"To create even more housing opportunities, to improve affordability, we should capitalize on the once in a lifetime funding from President Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act."
"I look forward to building on the incredible work of the bi-partisan Affordable Housing Transformational Task Force, under the leadership of former Representative Dominique Jackson, Chairman Roberts, and Vice Chairwoman Senator Julie Gonzales, to create stronger, healthier, and more affordable communities."
"And because we want to lead by example, we are saving Coloradans money by making your State Government more efficient and effective."
"We are on track to reduce our state’s office space footprint by 1 million square feet over the next three years, cutting costs and improving employee retention and morale."
We’re implementing best practices from the private sector to save millions in contract negotiations.
"And by improving our digital services, we are becoming leaner, less bureaucratic, and more convenient for the people of Colorado."
"In the coming weeks and months, we must continue these efforts and find new and innovative ways to save Coloradans money."
These policies matter to Coloradans.
"It isn't just dollars and cents back in our pockets, it’s peace of mind for our families, and that’s priceless!"
"So yes, there must be at least 50 ways to Save Coloradans Money, 50 ways to Save Coloradans Money."
"If it isn’t clear, saving Coloradans money and keeping our state affordable is my top priority during this legislative session."
And one of the biggest areas to save people money is healthcare.
"Thanks to Lt. Governor Dianne Primavera, who leads our Office of Saving People Money on Health Care, and our legislative champions, we have delivered on our promises to cut costs, even in the midst of the pandemic, cutting premiums and capping out of pocket drug costs.And we’re not done yet."
"Here in Colorado and across the nation, the pandemic has worsened what was already a horrifying trend of young children, teens, and adults suffering increased feelings of anxiety, isolation, depression, and other mental health issues."
Colorado needs to take bold action now.
"We want to partner with local governments and school districts to multiply the impact of historic funding to create a responsible, effective approach to addressing behavioral health needs from the mountains to the plains."
"Getting there means offering more integrated physical and mental health services, bolstering our often overworked behavioral health workforce, and most importantly, getting Colorado children the support they need to be happy – to just be kids."
"Thanks to the leadership of Representative Michaelson Jenet, we now have the I Matter Program, which connects our kids with critical mental health support."
We’re joined today by Melyssa Mead and her wonderful son Grady.
"When Grady - like so many kids across our state - needed mental health support this last year, Melyssa ran up against the harsh reality of an expensive and bureaucratic behavioral health system."
"She had first struggled to find the support her family needed, until she found the free I Matter Program."
Within minutes of reaching out through imattercolorado.
"org, Melyssa and Grady were on their way."
"And a few days later, they were scheduled for their first appointment.Grady, your future is bright!"
"Know that everyone in this room is rooting for you, and you are never alone.Let’s build on this success."
"Good work is already being done, and we have the opportunity to make it available for all Coloradans, especially our youth."
I want to thank the members of the Behavioral Health Transformational Task Force under the capable leadership of Committee Chairwoman Pettersen and Vice-chair Gonzales-Gutierrez.
We have confidence that your many excellent recommendations will lead to tremendous strides in looking after the mental health of our fellow Coloradans.
"As we pursue the improved health and wellbeing of Coloradans, especially our children, we shouldn’t overlook the power of a strong education."
Helping kids get a great education is the cornerstone and passion of my life's work.
"I’m so proud that over the last few years, we have done what generations before believed impossible: we established free, full-day kindergarten and universal preschool."
"We’re joined today by Alexis Ramirez and her son Benjamin, who know full well the importance of free kindergarten."
"Benjamin is attending kindergarten for free, along with more than 60,000 other Colorado five year olds thanks to the work we’ve done here."
Please join me in welcoming Alexis and Benjamin.
"But despite our progress, the pandemic has dealt an especially hard blow to our students, and made our educators go far beyond what any of us could have expected."
My administration worked tirelessly with school superintendents and local public health leaders to successfully bring Colorado children back to the classroom last year.
"We are providing free medical grade masks – with more than two million distributed to date – testing supplies for all students and staff, and are hosting on-site vaccine clinics to ensure that every eligible student and staff member gets the protection they deserve."
I want to thank every educator and school staff member who has done their part and then some to help keep Colorado schools open.
There is nothing more important to the future of our state than educating Colorado children.
"That’s why I have a plan for historic investment in Kindergarten through 12th grade education, which will reduce the Budget Stabilization Factor to a 13-year low, while increasing per pupil funding by roughly $12-13 thousand per classroom, supporting smaller class sizes and enhanced pay for teachers."
And we must take the RESPONSIBLE approach by setting money aside to keep up with these investments for future years.
"With this increase in funding, the Canon City School District will be able to compensate educators better and finally be able to fund full-time mental health professionals and counseling staff to provide the emotional support necessary to help students thrive in each and every one of its schools."
We’re joined today by Canon City school counselors Brian Vaniwarden and Stacy Andrews.
Please stand and be recognized.
"I’m also proposing stronger support for our state’s institutions of higher education, including an expansion of available financial aid, and investments to help reduce costs and keep tuition flat."
"Just as we are investing in the success of our students, we are also investing in the people and small businesses that power Colorado’s economy."
"I want to thank the Workforce Task Force, including Representative McCluskie and Senator Zenzinger and the Colorado Commission on Higher Education, for your commitment to crafting recommendations that will help create a thriving workforce where everyone in every community, in every corner of the state can “Live long and prosper”."
"We know this pandemic has been hard on workers across all industries, but perhaps none more than doctors, nurses, and healthcare professionals."
"I want to thank the Joint Budget Committee for their partnership on raising base wages to $15 an hour minimum for more than 30,000 Medicaid Home and Community Based Services workers who provide care to aging and disabled Coloradans, and now we are doing the same for similar positions in nursing facilities."
"Looking ahead, I am proposing that we waive licensing fees for nurses and mental health care workers, as well as for our nursing homes and assisted living facilities whose residents have been particularly vulnerable throughout the pandemic."
Eliminating these fees puts money back into the pockets of our dedicated healthcare workers.
"Putting this pandemic behind us means learning to live with the curveballs that COVID-19 may throw, but in order to do that, we need our hospitals to maintain capacity and ensure Coloradans get the care they need, no matter what."
"That’s why I will be proposing in the days ahead, a three year plan to make historic investments to stabilize our healthcare workforce and expand career paths for all Coloradans who heed the noble calling of caring for others."
"Moving forward, we can't let our society and our economy be impacted by hospital capacity, and I look forward to working with legislators and health care leaders to ensure that no matter where this pandemic takes us, we will be ready."
"Just as an earthquake is followed by aftershocks, we know that the overarching crisis of the pandemic has led to many other crises, perhaps lesser seen, but no less important to address."
"Some Coloradans are most impacted by the health risks of COVID-19, others are most pained by the rising cost of everyday items, disruptions to our children’s education, or the increase of crime in the communities we call home."
I want to take a moment to recognize the law enforcement professionals here with us today.
"In addition to Sheriff Pelle, we’re joined by several District Attorneys, Police Chiefs, Sheriffs and our State Patrol Officers, who spend every day keeping us safe."
"You always stand up for us, so today, let US stand up for YOU.Thank you."
"I’ve never been one to shy away from ambitious goals, which is why I want to spend the next five years making Colorado one of the top ten safest states in the country."
"Let’s “Make it so!” We’ve already taken critical steps in fighting crime and promoting public safety, and now we need to continue that work."
"I’m proud to put forward a responsible public safety plan that builds on historic legislation of years past, gives much-needed support and funding to local law enforcement while also investing in community-based approaches and organizations that can help prevent violent crime from occurring in the first place."
"Organizations like GRASP, which stands for Gang Rescue and Support Project, is run by peers who have turned their lives around and want to help others do the same."
"GRASP focuses on supporting Colorado youth through mental health support,at-risk intervention, job training and mentoring."
Please join me in welcoming GRASP’s Executive Director Johnnie Williams.
"We are going to make our communities safer by focusing on training and recruiting efforts for police, supporting community policing models, increasing access to mental health services, offering early intervention grants, increasing support for domestic violence victims, and making safety improvements in our schools and on our streets."
"I want to thank the Senate President Garcia and Senator Buckner who, along with Representatives Tipper and Ricks, are leading a particularly exciting initiative – Safer Streets – which will empower law enforcement to work directly with communities to create stronger, safer communities, with an emphasis on those areas most touched by crime."
We owe it to the people of Colorado to improve safety and make Colorado truly one of the ten safest states in the nation over the next five years.
"As Ben Franklin said, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."
Data and common sense tell us that preventing a crime does more to keep people safe than solving a crime after it was committed.
"With that being said, we also know that there are times when the swift arm of justice is the best solution, which is why I look forward to legislation to strengthen penalties for drug dealers peddling fentanyl in our communities."
Coloradans are sick and tired of seeing this drug ruin lives and kill loved ones.
It’s also time that we put forward bigger and bolder solutions to reduce homelessess.
"We know what works; we just need more of it: affordable and transitional housing, substance use treatment and recovery care, related residential programs, and permanent housing with wrap-around support services, and recipients of funds need to be held accountable for actually reducing homelessness."
We will stop at nothing to keep Coloradans safe.
Public safety is a critical component of a strong and healthy community.But it doesn’t end there.
"Building safer, healthier communities also means improving our air quality and meeting the climate crisis head-on."
"Only two weeks ago, our state watched in horror as the fire in Boulder County, fueled by extreme winds and drought conditions, swept through communities like yours and mine."
"These are our neighbors, our friends, and our family."
"Last year, historic mudslides destroyed portions of I-70 through Glenwood Canyon."
"And in 2020, the three largest wildfires in Colorado history scorched hundreds of thousands of acres, filling our skies with smoke-filled air for months on end."
I’m grateful for the work my administration has done in partnership with Colorado’s legislative leaders to move our state toward a cleaner more renewable energy future.
"We’ve set Colorado on a path to reducing emissions statewide, while also creating two new state parks and expanding access to our state trust lands."
"Thanks to our legislative champions, we have invested in the people and technology we need to effectively respond to climate disasters."
Tools like the agile FireHawk helicopter can give our firefighters the upper hand on the frontlines.
And targeted mitigation efforts can prevent small fires from becoming catastrophes.
"I’m requesting additional support for the men and women on the ground, including personal protective equipment, training, and other equipment needs for local fire departments."
The fresh mountain air that so many people associate with Colorado isn’t a given.
We have to fight to protect it.
I’m committed to cutting emissions and getting this done by improving air quality.
"It’s not about health alone; it’s about seizing the opportunity to reduce costs for Coloradans and save people money, while preserving the Colorado way of life."
"We will continue making targeted investments to improve air quality monitoring and enforcement, increase the availability of clean transportation options like electric school buses, accelerate our transition to a cleaner economy, and apply real accountability as we seek and secure environmental justice for those who are most impacted."
"And because water is the lifeblood of our state and our critical agriculture industry, we must work together across industries, divides, and state boundaries to secure a sustainable water future for all Coloradans."
We will continue to protect and aggressively assert Colorado’s water rights under all existing water compacts.
"And I am also committed to updating Colorado’s Water Plan to make it more climate resilient, and ensure that our cities, farms, and streams can thrive for generations to come."
"Just like 2021 was the year that Britney reclaimed her freedom and Taylor Swift reclaimed her music, it was also the year we began reclaiming what it means to live happy and healthy lives here in Colorado, even in the midst of tragedy — and this is the year we double down on that."
"Heck, even the beloved Colorado icon Casa Bonita is making a much-hoped-for comeback thanks to South Park’s Trey Parker and Matt Stone."
"The pandemic has taken so much from us, but no more."
"As Taylor says, I don't know about you but I'm feeling 2022, everything will be alright, because we know what we gotta do."
"It’s easy for us all to talk about the grand ideas we have for our beloved state, but it’s another thing entirely to turn words into actions."
"When I was elected Governor, I knew that I would be remembered not for who I was, where I came from, or even what I said at events like this, but for what I did to make a meaningful, measurable, positive impact on the lives of Coloradans."
"How our efforts helped businesses succeed, put money in people’s pockets, made streets safer, air cleaner, and lives healthier."
"If there is one thing that you take away from today, let it be my optimism for the days ahead, our commitment to Moving Colorado Forward by saving people money, improving affordability, and making our state a better place for everyone."
"Because this is Our Colorado, and I couldn’t be more proud to be your Governor."
"When I see the staggering beauty of the Rocky Mountains, I'm reminded of what it means to be a Coloradan."
It's true from the Flatirons to Fishers Peak to Pikes Peak to Longs Peak and beyond.
"You see, these mountains have withstood millions of years of whipping winds, pounding rains, cutting ice, and blistering fires."
"Cracks have formed and the rock has eroded, but nevertheless they stand tall, serving as a beacon of hope, a point of great pride and a reflection of who we are."
"So when I think about the state of our state, I'm brought back to our purple mountain majesties."
"The state of our state, just like the people of Colorado, is strong, it is steadfast, and in spite of everything, we are boldly moving forward."
"God bless you all, God bless our Colorado, and God bless the United States of America."
"On International Women’s Day, it’s great to say thank you, Madam Lieutenant Governor, for that introduction."
"Speaker Rendon and Pro Tem Atkins, thank you for being here tonight."
"To members of the Legislature and other state officials, thank you for joining us this evening."
"And to my wife, Jennifer, the First Partner."
"Thank you for being the heart of our family, and for everything you do for California."
"Given the state of our world, I don’t imagine there are many people outside these walls waiting on the words that will be said here tonight."
"But it is important for us to come together, nonetheless."
"Not just to mark how far we’ve come in our fight against COVID, but also to reaffirm our commitment to democratic institutions."
"As the people of Ukraine continue to come under assault, 2 million already displaced from their homes, we take strength from their contagious courage, and their willingness to fight for their freedom."
"Tonight, is also a moment for us to reflect on what it means to live in a society where elected leaders still settle our disagreements by and large with civility and compromise."
And how we derive strength from a government that reflects the people we represent.
"Our Speaker, son of working-class parents and grandson of Mexican immigrants, worked his way through California’s public education system, earning a Ph.D. from UC Riverside."
"Now, committed to ensuring every child has access to early learning."
"Our Pro Tem, born in poverty in Virginia, came to California and became a champion for housing and equal rights for all — the first openly gay woman to lead both the Assembly and state Senate."
"Our Chief Justice, public school graduate, descendant of migrant farmworkers, speaking out against income inequality and tackling the cost of justice for people in poverty."
"And our constitutional officers here tonight — they include the daughter of an Arkansas sharecropper, an immigrant from the Philippines, the daughters of parents born in China and Greece, one raised by a teacher from Panama, and the proud son of undocumented Mexican immigrants.Thank you for your service."
California does democracy like nowhere else in the world.
No other place offers opportunity to so many from such diverse backgrounds.
But we cannot take our democracy for granted.
"Authoritarian and illiberal impulses aren’t just rising overseas, they’ve been echoing here at home for some time."
"While we may not have strongmen literally waging war in our country, we are plagued by agents of a national anger machine fueling division, weaponizing grievance."
"Powerful forces and loud voices – stoking fear and seeking to divide us, weakening the institutions of our democracy."
"Counting on complacency to erode voting rights, scapegoating minorities."
Conjuring conspiracies and promoting “otherness.
Actively exploiting the “anger of the anxious.
"Anger that finds a home when people feel understandably disconnected from each other and our collective future, when that future doesn’t look as bright as the past."
Making them more susceptible to the siren calls of those trying to tear us apart.
"Foundationally, this is a threat we must all face, together and prove there is a better way – a California Way – forward."
The California Way means rejecting old binaries and finding new solutions to big problems.
"Take climate policy, for example.California has no peers."
"For years, we’ve set the rules and others have followed."
"But over time, we’ve learned we can’t solve big problems like climate change situationally, with short-term thinking."
"Look, no one’s naive about the moment we’re living in, with high gas prices and the geopolitical uncertainty fueling them."
In January we proposed to pause the gas tax increase.
"Now, it’s clear we must go further."
"That’s why — working with Legislative leadership — I’ll be submitting a proposal to put money back in the pockets of Californians, to address rising gas prices."
"But at a time, when we’ve been heating and burning up, one thing we cannot do is repeat the mistakes of the past by embracing polluters."
"Drilling even more oil, which only leads to even more extreme weather, more extreme drought, more wildfire."
What more evidence do we need?
"Just in the past few years, we’ve seen whole communities nearly wiped off the map.Greenville.Paradise.Grizzly Flats."
How many more are we willing to sacrifice?
"We need to be fighting polluters, not bolstering them."
"And in so doing, freeing us once and for all from the grasp of petro-dictators."
But this conversation can’t just be about oil supply.
Daily life still demands too much fossil fuel.That too has to change.
"Underscoring the importance of accelerating California’s leadership in clean technology, this is not just a national security and an environmental justice imperative — clean energy is this generation’s greatest economic opportunity."
A perfect example — our dominance in electric vehicle sales and manufacturing.
It was California’s policies that created this market.
"Now we have the opportunity to extend this leadership, to secure a critical component of the supply chain for batteries, by tapping one of the world’s largest lithium reserves – right here in California."
Our nation-leading climate investments — $38 billion — will ensure that other innovations will surely follow.
"Not by re-creating the 20th century by extracting more oil, but by extracting new ideas, drilling for new talent, by running our economy on a carbon-free engine.That’s the California Way."
"When it comes to the economy, California is unmatched."
"We dominate in research, innovation, entrepreneurialism, venture capital — and remain the world’s fifth largest economy."
"Our GDP growth has consistently outpaced not only the rest of the country – but most other, large western democracies."
"In December alone, 25 percent of America’s jobs were created right here in California."
A million new jobs in the last 12 months.
More new business starts during the worst of the pandemic than Texas and Florida combined.
But you know what makes us different than those states — besides the freedom of a woman’s right to choose?
"It’s that, as our businesses grow, we don’t leave our workers behind."
"Just consider what we did last year for the middle class in California, sending 12 billion dollars back — the largest state tax rebate in American history.But we didn’t stop there.We raised the minimum wage.We increased paid sick leave."
Provided more paid family leave.
Expanded child care to help working parents.
"And this year, with your support, we will do something no other state in America has done — provide Health For All, regardless of immigration status.That’s the California Way."
"Speaking of not leaving people behind, no state took bolder steps to protect public health and human life over the last two years."
"Our lockdowns, distressing as they were, saved lives."
Our mask mandates saved lives.Your choices saved lives.
"California’s experienced far lower COVID death rates than any other large state.Fewer than Texas, Ohio."
"Fewer than Florida — 35 percent, to be exact."
"But even with three quarters of Californians being fully vaccinated, we are mindful that we cannot let our guard down."
"That’s why last month, we put out our SMARTER Plan – the nation’s first blueprint to stay a step ahead of future variants and seasonal surges."
"I just want to thank you, thank you members of the Legislature for all you did these past two years to keep us safe."
But there’s another crisis we’re still tackling.
"That’s the crisis of homelessness, which has worsened over the last decade, not only here in California, but across the nation."
"Just a few years ago, California lacked any comprehensive strategy."
No accountability and no meaningful state resources to solve the problem.But that’s all changed.
"In just three years, we not only have a comprehensive plan, we’re also requiring new accountability and providing unprecedented investments for cities and counties on the front lines."
"And while we moved a record 58,000 people off the streets since the beginning of the pandemic, we recognize we have more to do – particularly to address what’s happening on our sidewalks, reaching people who need the help the most."
"Those with schizophrenia spectrum and psychosis disorders, many self-medicating with drugs or alcohol addictions."
That’s precisely what our encampment resolution grants and our new CARE Court seek to address.
"Getting people off the streets, out of tents, and into housing and treatment is essential to making our streets safe for everyone, but public safety certainly isn’t just about homelessness."
"Bobby Kennedy, just six weeks before he was killed by an assassin’s bullet, reminded us that the health of a society depends on the ability of people to walk their own streets in safety."
Not to be frightened into isolation.
"“A nation,” he said, “which surrenders to crime – whether by indifference or heavy-handed repression, is a society which has resigned itself to failure."
"Our approach is to be neither indifferent to the realities of the present day, nor revert to heavy-handed policies that have marked the failures of the past."
"We’re funding local law enforcement and prosecutors to investigate and solve more crime, bolstering the Attorney General’s Office, prosecuting organized theft rings and getting illegal guns off the streets."
"But we’re also investing hundreds of millions in new programs to tackle the root causes of crime, doubling down on proven violence-prevention programs.That’s the California way."
"Of course, to tackle any root cause, we need to talk about education."
"And I’m not talking about that version of education “reform” being promoted in some states, where they’re banning books, where you can sue your history teacher for teaching history, and where you can’t say the word “gay."
"I’m talking about real transformation of our public education system, like we’re doing right here in California."
"By creating choices – real choices – for parents, and unprecedented support for their kids."
"A whole new grade — transitional kindergarten for all, nine hours of enrichment a day with true universal before- and after-school programs.Expanded summer school."
"Universal, nutritious meals, millions of new child savings accounts and free community college.That’s the California Way."
"Look, people have always looked to California for inspiration."
"And now, in the midst of so much turmoil, with stacking stresses and dramatic social and economic change, California is doing what we have done for generations, lighting out the territory ahead of the rest, expanding the horizon of what’s possible."
"We know that government cannot be the entire solution, but we also know that government has always been part of the solution."
By creating a platform for people and the private sector to thrive.
"As Friedman said — we have a formula for success setting rules for risk-taking, not recklessness."
"Infrastructure, Research & Development, investing in our conveyor belt for talent — the finest system of higher education in the world, our community colleges, UCs and CSUs."
Ensuring society provides a hand up when people need help.
Maintaining our pro-immigrant policies and welcoming refugees from around the world.Those are California values.
"Embracing diversity, but also seeking common ground."
Pursuing greater connectedness.
"Not exploiting division, with performative politics, and memes of the moment but by unifying toward common purpose."
"Inviting more people with diverse perspectives, from different backgrounds –“To strive, to seek, to find, to not yield” — all into the fight for a better California.Thank you."
