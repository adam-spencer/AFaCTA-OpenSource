"These are the-my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference.",0
"And I say that not as the Democratic standard-bearer, but as a citizen of the United States who is concerned about the United States.",0
"Well, let me say I do think that parties are important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man.",0
"We have uh - in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh - at the same time we've had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: we've had a negative growth in our - in our national economy measured in real dollars.",1
"Jim, I hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed.",0
"And as the percentage of the population is increasing nationally, somehow the allegation that we don't care and we're going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the State of Texas is totally absurd.",1
We have to have our people at work.,0
"But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers' salaries.",1
"And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender.",0
"And we can do it again, if we take politics out of it.",0
You can keep your choice of doctor.,0
"But when it comes to our national security, I mean what I say.",0
"I want to address my remarks to the young people of America, because they're the ones that are going to spend most of their life in the 21st Century.",0

He said we cut Pell Grants.,0
And you look at a who's who in these campaigns around the 2 candidates.,0
Well I would first say he should have been tackling it for the last seven years.,0
So there's a -- this is a society that -- of ours that's got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong.,0
"We live in a global economy, not a national economy.",0
"But, of course, if you're a small business or a mom-and-pop business or a big business starting up here, you've got to pay even the reduced rate that Governor Romney's talking about.",1
"I'm not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts.",0
"Over the next four years, we'll continue to rally the armies of compassion, to help heal the hurt that exists in some of our country's neighborhoods.",0

Our military is meant to fight and win war.,0
"And then, Helen, I really believe where people are going to ask this question about trust, because I do think there's a pattern by Governor Clinton of saying one thing to please one group, and then trying to please another group.",1
"And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home -- which I really want to do, but I don't want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because we've achieved an objective -- is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility.",0
That is the true way I feel.,0
So that is not the way our democracy works.,0
I will pay down the national debt.,0
But we have no leadership.,0
Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands.,1
"We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins.",1

"In fact, some T-shirts that are very...",0
"Well, Mr. uh - Nelson, uh - I testified before two committees, House and Senate, on precisely the questions that you have asked.",0
I've said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors.,0
"I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get.",0
"I said I'd end the war in Libya -- in -- in Iraq, and I did.",1
"That's just flat wrong, and that's not what America is all about.",0
I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia.,0
But we aren't going to move America forward and we aren't going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements.,0
"But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is -- there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government.",0
I wanted to make it more effective and efficient.,0
You can't be on one hand this way and one hand another.,0
"Instead, it's gone up by that amount.",1
I do not say that.,0
I love the people here.,0
"I have been a governor of a big state, I have made education my number one priority.",0
"That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong.",0
"And I've gotten good people, like former Secretary of the Treasury Bob Rubin, for instance, who showed how to balance budgets and give you a good economy, to help me crunch these numbers and make them work.",1
"There may be some other statute that was already on the books, but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed.",0
"It's gone up by $2,500 a year.",1
I'll make sure we can reform Medicare and Social Security to preserve them for coming -- coming generations.,0
What we need to do is make certain we try to return people to work.,0
"The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America's economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that's one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.",1
To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism.,0

"For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.",1
And we've had many successful Muslims.,0
These things can be done if we have the right vision and the right restraint and the right leadership.,0
"I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be.",0
"A year ago he said, ""I was right then.",0
"But it's now time for the next stage of welfare reform, and include fathers and not only mothers.",0
"That's why I'm a big proponent of clean coal technology, to make sure we can use coal but in a clean way.",0
I am against- an across-the-board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters.,0
But let's take an example that we know is going to make a difference in the 21st century and that's our education policy.,0
I feel strongly about it because I don't want it to come out of my time.,0
I know a lot about that.,0
"And I need -- we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges.",0
That's how much I care about it.,0
"We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.",0
"But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obama's set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region.",1
"No, we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead; who won't blame the Congress; who will lead to bring down that deficit, who will make tough choices on spending",0
Amnesty means that - that you uh - that what you did was right.,0
I thought it was a bad decision.,0
So I consider that a compliment.,0
We have to be bold.,0
"Number one, I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again.",0
"But we went from 2,200 to 500.",1
We're going to make America safe again.,0
"What we can't do, I think, is try to characterize each other as bad people.",0
You've got to have the best intelligence in the world.,0
I vowed to the American people after that fateful day of September the 11th that we would not rest nor tire until we're safe.,0

"I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do, we are succeeding.",0

It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.,0
"I will not agree to any arms control agreement, including a freeze, that's not verifiable.",0
"I see jihadists continuing to spread, whether they're rising or just about the same level, hard to precisely measure, but it's clear they're there.",1

We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.,0
If we continue under Mr. Ford's policy by 1985 or '90 we'll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons.,0
And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer.,0
It's naive and dangerous to say that.,0
And we have to keep our military strong.,0
"And yes, it took me to veto 2 civil rights quota bills because I don't believe in quotas, and I don't think the American people believe in quotas.",1
And I wish we had time to let me explain.,0
And it costs more to keep them in prison than it does to send them to Harvard.,1
"So, thank you for giving me a chance to straighten the record.",0
And that's what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan.,0
"It's against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time.",0
"President Clinton did the same thing, because we have an obligation to protect you.",0
And we have a vacancy.,0
"Number one, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it.",1
"And secondly, the people that murdered Mr. Byrd got the ultimate punishment.",1
"We feel that there must be a continued obligation to the people, the some nineteen or twenty million people in Taiwan.",0

He's trying to attack me.,0
"But as governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end.",0
And when we're weak at home - weaker than all our allies - that weakness weakens the whole free world.,0
And therefore just kids were being shuffled through the school.,0
I'd like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn't happen in this country.,0
"We told him that we wouldn't get involved with his border dispute, and we've never revealed those papers that were given to Ambassador Glaspie on July the 25th.",1

"And the Republicans in recent years - not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years - have opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal aid to education, opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something.",1
What are low paying jobs?,0
That's one that I haven't...,0
I'd like to respond to that.,0
"Once you have a policy, then you have to go out and be aggressive and enforce that policy.",0
"And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off?",0
I'm interested in 240 million points of light.,0

"So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, you're going to get to go to school because we're going to match what the state puts up, and you're going to go to the school of your choice.",0
It's not driven by politics.,1
That's a lot of marijuana.,0
I have said on a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union.,0
We're not going to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane from Washington to Tokyo.,0
"Secondly, we've set up what's called the -- well, first of all, I agree with my opponent that the biggest threat facing this country is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist network.",0
"And we have serious problems with our conventional forces at the present time, and they'll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions.",0

And women have respect for me.,0
Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his.,0
"But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I don't know, you know, how credible that is.",0
"And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.",1
And I'd like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated?,0
The Secretary of State admitted that this morning.,0

He raised a whole bunch of them.,0
And yet think about where we are: Added 1.9 million new jobs over the past 13 months.,1
"This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol.",0
"It's an example of how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations all of whose particular positions we don't support, even though we support in general the hope that over time, particularly if we can get those reductions in strategic weapons, if we can get a comprehensive test ban treaty, if we can negotiate with the Soviet Union and bring down the level of conventional forces in Europe with deeper cuts in the Soviet side, yes, at some point it may be possible to reduce defense outlays and use those for important things here at home, like jobs and job training and college opportunity and health and housing and the environment and the things that all of us care about.",0
But everybody knew what we were doing and I've opposed that.,0

"spending - we can afford the tax cuts I have proposed and probably mainly because Mr. Carter's economic policy has built into the next five years, and on beyond that, a tax increase that will be taking $86 billion more out of the people's pockets than was taken this year.",0
"They want to stay free, independent perhaps of us, but certainly independent of the Communists.",0
"I guess the one thing that concerns me about this, Ann, is this attempt to label things which all of us believe in.",0
"I refer, for example, to distressed areas.",0
And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap?,0

I did support it at the time.,0

Because it's the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas.,0
My opponent talks about fiscal sanity.,0
Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.,1

"It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $.50 would be added on top of that.",1
I'll give you an example.,0
"But to indicate in advance how we would respond, to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect; it would certainly be inappropriate; it would not be in the best interests of the United States.",0
That's why I want another 4 years.,0
It's the wrong thing to do.,0
And you cannot keep both promises.,0
It also means that we've got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education.,0
"Now, to suggest that because two Republican presidents tried to pass the SALT treaty - that puts them on its side - I would like to say that President Ford, who was within 90% of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office, is emphatically against this SALT treaty.",1
