We don't have any inspection.,0
You don't finance long-term debt with short-term money.,0

"We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...",1

"And we start -- we don't do it exclusively -- but we start by rolling back George Bush's unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain-Kerry Commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get.",1
They analyzed the senator's plan.,0
High-income people are doing just fine in this economy.,0
"So -- but, look, you're not interested in hearing politicians pointing fingers.",0
"And we said, hey, we've got to unleash the Bush kids.",0
Legislators make law; judges interpret the Constitution.,0
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got to protect them.,0
It starts with a billion dollar pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform.,1
"Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.",0
The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties?,0
The president says I've changed my mind.,0
"Another thing that I'd like to say is this: In our international trade, as I said in my op- opening statement, we have become the arms merchant of the world.",0
And that's what my campaign is about and I'm not going to raise taxes the way Senator Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy.,0
We can't deal with them.,0
I don't believe Hillary will.,0
So I went to the United Nations.,0
"Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States.",1

And I did as secretary of state.,1
"And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as.",0
"Now, all these fellows with thousand-dollar suits and alligator shoes running up and down the halls of Congress that make policy now -- the lobbyists, the PAC guys, the foreign lobbyists, and what-have-you, they'll be over there in the Smithsonian, you know --",0

"What I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.",0
"But tell her it's not all that gloomy; we're the US, we faced tough problems before.",0

"Go back to work at 30,000 bucks a month representing some other country.",0
"The Dorgan Task Force, which included two internal revenue commissioners, one a Republican, one a Democrat.",0

We've got to deal with things like racial profiling.,0
We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.,1
"Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar.",0

Whether it be fighting for an HMO patient's bill of rights.,0
"Now, it's true that I say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care, because children are relatively cheap to insure and we don't want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma.",0
