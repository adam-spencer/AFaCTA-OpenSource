"Now, let me say, some people say we can't do this but Hawaii does it.",0
So I'm satisfied with it.,0

"I'm an optimist, but we have to make the right choices, to be fiscally responsible and to create the new jobs of the future.",0
This is not mud slinging.,0
"To do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area.",0

What I criticized were the policies that made it necessary to go to Korea.,1

The feelings are very strong.,0
"I can think of nothing that will be a greater blow to the prestige of the United States among the free nations in Asia than for us to take Senator Kennedy's advan- advice to go - go against what a majority of the members of the Senate, both Democrat and Republican, did - said in 1955, and to say in advance we will surrender an area to the Communists.",1

"You shouldn't be worrying if you get a new job as to whether that's gonna -- and part of our plan is to make it what they call portable -- big word, but that means if you're working for the Jones Company and you go to the Smith Company, your insurance goes with you.",0
"And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability.",0
That's why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians.,0
"Yeah, but wouldn't that suggest to the American people, then, here's a quality person, if he decided that he could automatically get the nomination of either party?",0
"But it seems to me the kids ought to -- if they've started, they ought to stop and just don't do it.",0
"Now, why did they reject it?",0
"Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful?",0
"And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we'll get more revenue and we'll have a more prosperous economy.",0
I think I did the right thing.,0
But generally I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right.,0
Hillary Clinton has been after this for years.,1
I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own.,0
So there's a great deal of cynicism out there.,0
"Not to the schools but to -- you know, 46% of the teachers in Chicago, public school teachers, send their kids to private school.",1
Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.,0
And I want to keep it alive in child care and in other entitlements.,0
But I don't believe this president can.,0
And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.,0
"The United States today, according to Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, is a- at a peak in its uh - influence and power in the Middle East.",0
I think you ought to get the break.,0
"It was principled, and it was strategic.",0
I would have put them in place earlier.,0
It can't get any worse.,0
Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum.,1
And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns.,0
"Look, we're in an information age.",0
"I picked Lloyd Bentsen, distinguished, strong, mature, a leader in the Senate, somebody whose qualifications nobody has questioned.",0
"I would meet with the leaders of the Congress, with all the newly elected members of the Congress and as many others with whom I could meet between the time of the election and the inauguration, and we would present a jobs program.",0
"Number two, we've got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority.",0
"In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens.",1
"Now, it's $4.00 a gallon.",1
And so I just have a different approach.,0
"Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans.",1
Earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget.,1
"If we had a disaster today, could they handle it?",0
"Now, I think we should be reluctant to get involved in someplace in a foreign country.",0
So our troops will come home at that point.,1
She's a reformer through and through.,0
"There are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people, more than their pets, sometimes.",1
"Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get.",1
"I want to make sure the seniors have the promise made will be a promise kept, but I want younger workers to be able to manage some of their own money, some of their own payroll taxes in the private sector under certain guidelines to get a better rate of return on your own money.",0
I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.,0
I will make sure that we invest in our country and our families.,0
And now we're going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks.,0
"Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago?",0
"But -- but what it did do is to -- if you extrapolated how much money we're talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.",1
They have had their chance to get something done.,0
And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.,0
"And I'm going to keep on vetoing them, because I don't think we're taxed too little.",0
That's part of my health care plan.,1
And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem.,0
"Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country.",0
Dick Cheney's counted as a small business.,0
He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.,0
So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings.,1
That's the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it's a important judgment.,0
I think it's important for NATO to be strong and confident.,0
I want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas but also the energy sources of the future.,0
Abraham Lincoln was a great president of all the people; but he was selected by his party at a key time in history because his party stood for something.,0
"Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.",0
These are people that kill women and treat women horribly.,1
"The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.",1
I think this is the right strategy.,0
Wasn't this the George Bush that supported Mr. Meese?,0
We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas.,1
Let's get to their questions.,0
$500 per child under 18.,1
"I don't take credit for all the good things that have happened in America, but I take credit for what I've tried to do to work with others to make good things happen.",0
And so we said: Let's raise the standards.,0
We're having trouble meeting recruiting goals.,0
"I think it's important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we're helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we're saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments.",0
"If you'd just tell us what you're going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan.",0
"Everybody knows it's hard work, because there's a determined enemy that's trying to defeat us.",0
"That's why I tried to be so specific in this campaign to have a mandate, if elected, so that Congress will know what the American people have voted for.",0
When it comes to timetables it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place.,0
"Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much, much smaller than it was.",1
"And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands.",0
They've never seen anything happen in that town.,0
"And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief.",1
"I want to give a special thanks to my wife Elizabeth, my daughter Robin for their love and support, and thank the people who are listening and watching all over America.",0
"You know, after we killed bin Laden I was at ground zero for a memorial and talked to a young women who was four years old when 9/11 happened.",0
If I'm president I will create -- help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.,0
They have to pay up.,0
I know he wants to disown it.,0
You also have investments in Chinese companies.,1
And we pushed our allies aside.,0
Those are the kinds of choices that the American people face right now.,1
I say that to both political parties.,0
"But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.",1
We do so in my state of Texas.,0
"Senator Obama twice said in debates he would sit down with Ahmadinejad, Chavez and Raul Castro without precondition.",1
"The elements of government through these tax incentives For example, a business that would not have, for a period of time, an increase in the property tax reflecting its development of the unused property that it was making wouldn't be any loss to the city because the city isn't getting any tax from that now.",1
It seems to me that we can go from there to uh - the uh - grain sales.,0
"I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on.",0
But let's get back to the core issue here.,0
"So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh - put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions.",0
"As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries.",0
I have had it in every single proposal I've sent to the Congress.,1
I was deeply concerned about seniors having to choose between prescription drugs and food.,0
We need to get rid of that provision because it's killing regional and small banks.,0
How about a line item veto?,0
It's a sick art form.,0
I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me.,0
It means that there will be increased hires.,0
You've got to reassert your ownership in this country and you've got to completely reform our government.,0
"Actually just going to them and saying, ""We're going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody's going to get a lower rate.""",1
"But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended.",0
"Let's look at the vote on the Congo, the vote was seventy to nothing against the Soviet Union.",1
Government shouldn't be a heavy hand.,0
General Ridgway has said the same thing.,1
More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us.,1
We now have 2500 hospices.,1
So this is going to be an important issue.,0
And yet he tells you he's for a middle- class tax cut.,0
"We have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power.",0
"By being steadfast and resolute and strong, by keeping our word, by supporting our troops, we can achieve the peace we all want.",0
"John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important.",0
"There isn't any question but that we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war; to move toward controlled disarmament; to control tests; but also let's have in mind this: when Senator Kennedy suggests that we haven't been making an effort, he simply doesn't know what he's talking about.",0
"But I think that one area we agree on is the important of parents and the importance of schools, because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they are less likely to engage in these kinds of violent acts.",0
"And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.",1
"Mr. George Allen, head of your Information Service, has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science.",0
I'm not going to set the White House visitors schedule before I'm president of the United States.,0
The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.,0
I thought he made the right decision to do so.,0
"Is he talking about a former Governor of the State of California, who is a former prosecutor, a Republican named Earl Warren, because I think Chief Justice Earl Warren was an outstanding Chief Justice and I think most Americans do too.",0
"When I'm president, I'm sending that back to Congress and we're going to get a real prescription drug benefit.",0
And they provide us energy and they provide us innovation and they start companies like Intel and Google.,0
My intentions are to earn your vote and earn your confidence.,0

"But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan.",1
"We relied on the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Middle East, which passed the Senate.",1
We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border.,0
But you have no plan.,0
I think it would be a great gesture.,0
But here's what I said.,0
"And with regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.",0
"Secondly, of course we've been involved with Iran.",0
"And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives.",0
"That's what's happening in Iraq, and it wasn't a tactic.",0
"If you have a child, you got tax relief.",1
"We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before -- 2,300,000 more are receiving them -- even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them.",1
"It had a very, very big impact.",0
"Look, that's where World War I started in the Balkans.",0
"But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran.",0
That's one major war explosion in a warhead.,0
That's not the right answer for America.,0
"That's why we've kept on pushing trade deals, but trade deals that make sure that American workers and American businesses are getting a good deal.",0
"Now, this is guy a who, along with others, has taken great risk for great freedom.",0
"People can look it up, you're right.",0
Let's take all these four years in a row.,0
Let me restate uh - our policy.,0
I've done it my entire life.,0
This Janet Yellen of the Fed.,0
"I would like to make a change in the regulation that discriminates against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her father's or her husband's benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get.",0

"In the case of the Helsinki agreement - it may have been a good agreement at the beginning, but we have failed to enforce the so-called basket three part, which insures the right of people to migrate, to join their families, to be free, to speak out.",1
What we can't do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place.,0
We live-we bring everybody along.,0
I am optimistic and I believe we can keep this longest expansion going.,0
"Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history - the payroll tax increase for Social Security - which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most.",1
"And that's why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though it's an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis.",0
We are the greatest country on the face of the earth.,0
"No, it's going to totally help you.",0
"I think that would destroy the integrity and the strength of NATO, and I am totally opposed to it.",0
And let's keep -- never forget the struggle that Americans are in today.,0

Firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them.,0

"But I will say as a Democrat, I was a real piker, Mr. President.",0
That's why they're fighting so vociferously.,0
And we're going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years.,0

"We just heard the President's answer for the problems at the barracks in Lebanon, where 241 marines were killed.",1
"Mr. Ford has shown an absence of leadership, and an absence of a grasp of what this country is and what it ought to be.",0
"And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction.",1
"No, they were taunting us.",0
"You're going to lose some deductions, and you can't buy the sales pitch.",0
"And we won the nomination by going out into the streets - barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers' markets and livestock sale barns - and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people.",0
The revenues exceed the expenses in Social Security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made.,1

That's why exports have significantly increased under my presidency.,1
"I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan.",0
"We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires.",1
That was a command decision made by the commanders on the spot and based with what they thought was best for the men there.,1
That's what the question in this campaign is about.,0
Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent.,1

"It was a nation building mission, and it was not very successful.",1
And the initiatives that we took in southern Africa are the best examples of what this administration is doing and will continue to do in the next four years.,0
"We'll never have that world leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles.",0
"If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don't lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children.",0
"But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked.",0
She finally gave it up.,0
So we've got to get our education system right.,0
"But I'm going to make an important point here, Jim.",0
So I don't -- I don't think there's any doubt that Senator Obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes.,0

We are once again reliable suppliers and I would never use food as a political tool like our predecessors did.,1
I'm against giving anybody any kind of preference for something they're not qualified for.,0

It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is.,0
